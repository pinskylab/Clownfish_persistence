\section*{Abstract}
Determining whether a metapopulation can persist requires an understanding of both demographic parameters and connectivity among patches. This is well understood in theory but has proved challenging to test empirically. We assessed persistence for a network of patches along a coastline in a metapopulation of yellowtail anemonefish (\textit{Amphiprion clarkii}) using seven years of annual sampling data along 30 km of coastline. Despite stable population sizes through time and sufficient production of surviving offspring for replacement, the spatial pattern of connectiviy made the metapopulation unlikely to persist in isolation. To persist, the metapopulation would need higher fecundity or would need to retain essentially all of the recruits it produced. This assessment of persistence in a marine metapopulation shows that stable abundance alone is not an indicator of persistence, emphasizing the necessity of untangling demographic and connectivity processes to understand metapopulation dynamics.

\section*{Introduction} 

The dynamics and persistence of metapopulations depend both on connectivity among patches and on demographic rates within each patch \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, hanski1998metapopulation}. For marine species, connectivity among habitat patches primarily occurs during planktonic larval stages when individuals are hard to track and are able to travel long distances with ocean currents. Because larval connectivity has been perceived to be the greatest uncertainty in these systems, research has centered on quantifying that component \citep[reviewed by][]{white2019connectivity}. More recently, it has become apparent that variation in demographic rates among patches is an equally uncertain aspect of marine metapopulation dynamics \citep{hameed2016inverse, white2011oceanographic}. Given both of those uncertainties, and driven by both fundamental ecological questions and applied needs \citep{botsford_dependence_2001,white_population_2010}, a large body of theory has developed to describe how connectivity and local demography interact to determine whether marine metapopulations persist \citep{burgess2014beyond, botsford2019population}. Testing this theory, however, has proven substantially more difficult.

For any population to persist, individuals must on average replace themselves during their lifetime. Assessing replacement must account for demographic processes across the life cycle, including how likely individuals are to survive to the next age or stage, their expected fecundity at each stage, the survival to recruitment of any offspring produced, and the distribution of offspring across space \citep{hastings_persistence_2006}. A metapopulation can persist via two mechanisms: 1) at least one patch achieves replacement in isolation (self-persistence), or 2) multiple patches receive enough recruitment to achieve replacement through multi-generational loops of connectivity with other patches in the metapopulation (network persistence) \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, burgess2014beyond}. Theory predicts that habitat patches that are large relative to the mean dispersal distance are likely to be self-persistent \citep{white_population_2010}. % In the first case (termed self-persistence), enough of the offspring produced at one patch are retained there for it to persist. In the second case (network persistence), closed loops of connectivity among  patches - in which offspring from one patch recruit to another patch but eventually send offspring back to the first in a future generation - provide the patches with enough recruitment to persist within the network. Theory predicts that habitat patches that are large relative to the mean dispersal distance are likely to be self-persistent \citep{white_population_2010}. % Is this sentence relevant here? %If one patch persists, the metapopulation persists.

%Marine larvae were once thought to be well-mixed and dispersed far on ocean currents \citep[e.g.][]{roughgarden_recruitment_1988}, suggesting widespread connectivity among patches and largely open populations. Recent advances in estimating connectivity through natural tags and genetics, however, suggest that dispersal may be more limited \citep[e.g.][]{daloia_self-recruitment_2013, hameed2016inverse, almany2017larval}, and local persistence of marine populations on a small spatial scale possible. % Commenting out these sentences right now per Malin's comment that they are similar to the start of the paragraph two down - might revisit and revise

New ways of identifying individuals and determining their origins now allow better measurements of connectivity in marine populations \citep{almany2017larval, daloia_self-recruitment_2013}. Additionally, a better appreciation of the relevant theory has led to measurement of the demographic factors necessary to assess persistence in field metapopulations \citep{carson2011evaluating, hameed2016inverse, johnson2018integrating, salles_coral_2015}. To date, research has suggested that populations on isolated islands can be self-persistent, which might be expected given that they lack nearby populations from which to receive larvae \citep{salles_coral_2015}. In contrast, small habitat patches spread across a larger reef metapopulation appear to rely on input from surrounding and intervening patches for persistence \citep{johnson2018integrating}. Isolated habitat patches are rare in the marine environment and intervening habitat patches are often important contributors to metapopulation dynamics. Persistence has yet to be quantified in the field for a continuous marine metapopulation, such as all of the patches along a coastline. 

% MOVE TO DISCUSSION PER WILL'S COMMENT ON GOOGLE DOC! % The number of studies estimating demographic rates and connectivity in marine metapopulations is growing \citep{carson2011evaluating, salles_coral_2015, johnson2018integrating, garavelli2018population}, but most use data from one or a few years. Longer data sets enable better estimates of long-term average rates, rather than assuming the demographic and dispersal rates from a particular year or two are representative. Long data sets are also useful for explicitly considering uncertainty, both to assess how well we understand persistence for a population and to assess which parameters contribute most to our uncertainty. Finally, sampling over many years provides abundance trends to compare with persistence metrics.

% Characterizing and understanding variability is important as it can drive dynamics, even allowing persistence when average rates would not (SEBASTIAN CITATIONS), but using data across several years to get a sense of the range of rates and an average is a first step. Having multiple years of data can provide a range of estimates, rather than one point value, and help us understand which parameters contribute most to uncertainty in persistence. 

Here, we further our understanding of metapopulation dynamics in a network of patches along a coastline through a study of yellowtail anemonefish (\textit{Amphiprion clarkii}) in the Philippines. We assessed persistence for all patches of habitat within a metapopulation spread across 30 km of coastline. Based on seven years of data, we found that, despite containing multiple patches with large abundances that were stable over time, the metapopulation was not likely to be persistent without immigration from outside patches.

\subsection*{Persistence theory and metrics}
% For a population to persist, each individual must on average replace itself \citep[e.g.][]{hastings_persistence_2006, botsford2019population}. In non-spatially structured populations, we use criteria such as the average number of recruiting offspring each individual produces during its life (called $R_0$ when the population is age-structured and density-independent) or the growth rate of the population (such as the dominant eigenvalue $\lambda$ of an age-structured Leslie matrix) \citep{caswell_matrix_2001, burgess2014beyond}. For spatially-structured populations, we must also consider the spatial spread of offspring, often represented through a dispersal kernel or connectivity matrix \citep{burgess2014beyond}. %\citep[e.g.][]{cowen_scaling_2006, buston2011probability, hogan_local_2011, daloia2015patterns}). 

%%% RE-ORDER METRICS TO MATCH ORDER OF DETAILED DESCRIPTION BELOW! MOVE LR BACK TO #4!!
We considered four primary metrics to assess whether and how the anemonefish metapopulation was persistent: 1) lifetime recruit production (LRP) to assess whether the metapopulation had enough offspring that survived anywhere to achieve replacement, 2) self-persistence (SP) to assess whether any individual patch could persist in isolation without input from other patches, 3) network persistence ($\lambda_c$) to assess whether the metapopulation was persistent as a connected unit, and 4) local replacement (LR) to assess whether a sufficient number of recruits were retained anywhere within the metapopulation to acheive replacement, without explicitly estimating dispersal patterns. We explain each metric below in detail. To represent the uncertainty in our estimates, we calculated each metric 1000 times, sampling each input parameter from a distribution representing the uncertainty in the empirical estimate (details in 
Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}). In our results, we show best estimates of each metric along with uncertainty bounds, defined as the middle 95\% of the distribution of values calculated in this Monte Carlo procedure. We provide additional method details, results, tables and figures in the appendix (methods: Appendix \ref{APP_SUPP_METHODS}, results: Appendix \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS}, tables: Appendix \ref{APP_SEC_TABLES}, figures: Appendix \ref{APP_SEC_FIGURES}).% Should this have the \% Reference the section with \ref?

\paragraph*{Lifetime recruit production (LRP)}
$\text{LRP}_i$ is the expected number of recruits a recruit on patch $i$ will produce in its lifetime,

\begin{equation}
\text{LRP}_i = \text{LEP}_i \times S_e, \label{EQN_LRP}
\end{equation}

where $\text{LEP}_i$ (lifetime egg production) is the patch-specific number of eggs a recruit produces in its lifetime and $S_e$ (egg-recruit survival) is the fraction of eggs that survive to become recruits (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Schematic}).

If $\text{LRP} \geq 1$, individuals produced enough surviving offspring, before considering dispersal, to potentially achieve replacement. If $\text{LRP} < 1$, the population could not persist without input from outside patches. We considered all recruits produced by adults in our metapopulation to estimate $\text{LRP}_i$, regardless of where they settled. %This estimates the potential for the entire metapopulation to persist.

\paragraph*{Self-persistence (SP)} 

$\text{SP}_i$ is the number of offspring a recruit produces that survive to become recruits and settle in the natal patch,

\begin{equation}
%SP_i &= \text{LEP} \times \text{LR} \\
%SP_i &= \text{LEP} \times S_e \times \frac{p_{i,i} \times \text{\# recruits from patch i}}{S_e \times \text{\# eggs produced by patch i}} \\ 
%SP_i &= \text{LEP} \times S_e \times \frac{p_{i,i} \times \text{\# recruits from site $i$}}{S_e \times \text{\# eggs produced by patch $i$}} \\
%SP_i &= \text{LEP} \times S_e \times p_{i,i}. \label{EQN_SP}
\text{SP}_i = \text{LRP}_i \times p_{i,i}, \label{EQN_SP}  % check this...
\end{equation}

where $p_{i,i}$ is the probability of larval retention on patch $i$.

A patch $i$ is self-persistent if $\text{SP}_i \geq 1$. If at least one patch is self-persistent, the metapopulation as a whole persists as well \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, burgess2014beyond}. 

%% MOVE TO SUPPLEMENT!
% Our equation for SP is a modification of that used in \cite{burgess2014beyond}, which uses LEP to represent offspring produced and uses local retention (the number of surviving recruits that disperse back to the natal patch divided by the number of eggs produced by the natal patch) to capture egg-recruit survival and dispersal combined: $\text{LEP} \times \text{local retention} \geq 1$. We modify this to include egg-recruit survival in the offspring term instead, using LRP in place of LEP. %, to assess whether a particular patch $i$ is self-persistent.

\paragraph*{Network persistence ($\lambda_c$)}

Network persistence is the largest real eigenvalue $\lambda_C$ of the realized connectivity matrix $C$,

\begin{equation}
C_{i,j} = \text{LRP}_i \times p_{i,j}, \label{EQN_Connectivity_matrix}
\end{equation} 

created by multiplying lifetime recruit production ($\text{LRP}_i$) by dispersal probabilities among pairs of patches ($p_{i,j}$) \citep{burgess2014beyond}. The diagonal entries of $C$ are the self-persistence values for each patch ($\text{SP}_i$).

Network persistence explicitly considers dispersal of individuals among patches in addition to the reproduction and survival at each patch and requires $\lambda_C \geq 1$ for the network to persist without outside input \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, white_population_2010, burgess2014beyond}.

\paragraph*{Local replacement (LR)}

Local replacement (LR) is the number of recruits a recruit produces in its lifetime that return to settle within the focal metapopulation. LR is related to LRP, but in contrast, LRP also includes recruits that settle outside of the focal metapopulation. LR is defined as 

\begin{equation}
\text{LR} = \text{LEP}_* \times R_e, \label{EQN_LR}
\end{equation}

where $\text{LEP}_*$ is lifetime egg production averaged across patches and $R_e$ is the proportion of eggs that survived and returned to recruit at the patches in our focal metapopulation (the 30 km section of coastline). $R_e$ is a modification of egg-recruit survival ($S_e$) that implicitly includes dispersal. 
% Like network persistence, local replacement (LR) assesses whether the population is locally self-sustaining. Rather than considering dispersal explicitly as network persistence does, local replacement modifies LRP to estimate the average number of recruits produced per individual that return to settle within our sites. We estimate LR by multiplying LEP by the proportion of eggs produced that survive and return to recruit at our sites ($R_e$), a modification of egg-recruit survival that implicitly includes dispersal. If $LR \geq 1$, individuals produce enough locally-retained offspring to replace themselves and the population can persist in isolation. % One way we assess whether our population is locally self-sustaining is by estimating the number of recruits produced per individual that return to settle within our sites, local replacement (LR).

If $\text{LR} \geq 1$, enough offspring were locally retained to achieve replacement if they were evenly spread among patches, but the actual dispersal patterns among the metapopulation patches may still prevent replacement if the pattern of multigenerational replacement does not satisfy the \cite{hastings_persistence_2006} criterion. LR and $\lambda_c$ both assess the ability of our patches to persist as an isolated group, but LR treats the network as one large homogenous patch while $\lambda_c$ explicitly accounts for the struture and connectivity among patches.  

\subsection*{Study species}

We focused on a tropical metapopulation of yellowtail anemonefish (\textit{Amphiprion clarkii}, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Map_and_photo}c). Yellowtail anemonefish have a mutualistic relationship with anemones that house small colonies of fish \citep{buston2003social, fautin1992field}. Yellowtail anemonefish are protandrous hermaphrodites and maintain a size-structured hierarchy; within an anemone, the largest fish is the breeding female, the next largest is the breeding male, and any smaller fish are non-breeding juveniles. The fish move up in rank to become breeders only after the larger fish have died. In the tropical patch reef habitat of the Philippines, yellowtail anemonefish primarily spawn from November to May and lay clutches of benthic eggs that the parents protect and tend \citep{ochi1989mating, holtswarth2017fecundity}. Larvae hatch after about six days and spend 7--10 days in the water column before returning to reef habitat to settle in an anemone \citep{fautin1992field}.

Anemonefish are well-suited to metapopulation studies because dispersal only occurs during the larval phase and adults have limited movement on discrete habitat patches (anemones) \citep[e.g.,][]{buston2013marine, salles_coral_2015, almany2017larval}. Yellowtail anemonefish tend to behave more like other reef fishes, with wider-ranging territories and stronger swimming abilities \citep{hattori1991life, ochi1989mating} than the smaller \textit{A. percula} commonly used in metapopulation studies \citep[e.g.,][]{buston2011probability, salles_coral_2015}. %As we show later, survival in yellowtail anemonefish is also lower than \textit{A. percula} and more similar to other damselfishes. 

\paragraph*{Field data collection}

We focused on a set of nineteen reef patches spanning 30 km along the western coast of Leyte island facing the Camotes Sea in the Philippines (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Map_and_photo}a). The habitat patches covered approximately 20\% of the sampling region and consisted of rocky patches of coral reef separated by sand flats (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Map_and_photo}a,b). To the north, the patches were isolated from nearby habitat with no substantial reef habitat for at least 20 km, a distance greater than the mean dispersal distance for this species \citep{pinsky2010using}. As such, we considered this to be a relatively isolated metapopulation. Located near a populated coastline, the region experiences anthropogenic effects including fishing, pollution, and runoff from agriculture and a nearby riverbed gravel mine, as well as reef-destroying storms like Haiyan and other typhoons in 2013.% Pinsky et al. 2010 paper: (4–27 km with median 11 km)

From 2012-2018, we sampled fish and habitat at most patches each year (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_PercHabSampled}). Divers using SCUBA and tethered to GPS readers swam the extent of each patch and visited anemones inhabited by yellowtail anemonefish. At each anemone, the divers caught fish 3.5 cm and larger, took a tissue sample, measured fork length, and noted tail color as an indicator of life stage \citep{moyer1976geographical}. Starting in 2015, fish 6.0 cm and larger were also tagged with a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag unless already tagged. Divers also looked for eggs around each anemone and measured and photographed any clutches found. In total, we took fin clips from and genotyped 2406 fish and PIT-tagged 1929 fish across all years and patches combined, marking 3053 individual fish. % with an average of XX fish clipped and XX fish tagged per year.  % n_offspring_genotyped (785) + n_parents_genotyped (1719) = 2504, not 2772? CHECK!

\subsection*{Estimating demographic and dispersal parameters from empirical data} 

\paragraph*{Parentage analysis and dispersal kernel}  % Check with Katrina/Michelle that this captures the highlights and includes the right references

Over seven years of sampling, we genotyped 1729 potential parents and 791 juveniles (some fish fall into both categories in different years) at 1340 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and found 71 parent-offspring matches \citep{catalanoInPrepconnectivity}. We used a distance-based generalized Gaussian dispersal kernel fit from the parent-offspring matches \citep{catalanoInPrepconnectivity, bode2018estimating}, where the relative probability of dispersal $p(d)$ is a function of distance $d$ in kilometers and parameters $\theta$ and $K_d$ that control the shape and scale of the kernel (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}a, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}, uncertainty details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}). The dispersal kernel estimates the relative dispersal by distance for fish that have survived and recruited, so it does not separately estimate pre-settlement mortality. To find the probability of fish dispersing among our patches, we numerically integrated the dispersal kernel --- normalized to 0.5 to represent dispersal in one direction along the coast --- using the distance from the middle of the origin patch ($i$) to the closest ($d_1$) and farthest ($d_2$) edges of the destination patch ($j$), with distances calculated using the \texttt{geosphere} package in R \citep{geosphere2017R}:

\begin{equation} % might not need this equation...
%p_{A, B}(d) = \int_{d_1}^{d_2} e^k e^{-(e^k d)^\theta}  dd. \label{EQN_integratingDK}
%p_{i, j}(d) = \int_{d_1}^{d_2} z e^{-(zd)^\theta}  dd. \label{EQN_integratingDK}
p_{i,j} = \frac{e^{K_d}\theta}{2\Gamma({\frac{1}{\theta})}} \int_{d_1}^{d_2}e^{-(e^{K_d}d)^\theta}  dd, \label{EQN_integratingDK}
\end{equation}

where $\Gamma$ indicates the gamma function.

\paragraph*{Growth and survival: mark-recapture analyses}

Fish marked through geneotyping and PIT tags allowed us to estimate growth and survival through mark-recapture. In total, we had 3053 marked fish with size and stage data at each capture. 

For growth, we used a von Bertalanffy growth curve:
%estimated the parameters of a von Bertalanffy growth curve in the growth increment form relating the length at first capture $L_t$ to the length at a later capture $L_{t+1}$ \citep{hart2009estimating}, where $L_\infty$ is the average asymptotic maximum size across the metapopulation and $K$ is the growth rate: %check that I actually defined those well... % in the growth increment form (according to Hart and Chute) - need to actually get a copy of the Fabens paper, doesn't seem to be available on Google Scholar

\begin{equation} \label{EQN_VBL} 
\begin{split}
L_{t+1} & = L_t + (L_\infty - L_t)[1 - e^{(-k)}] \\
 & = e^{(-k)}L_t + L_\infty[1 - e^{(-k)}],
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $L_\infty$ is the asymptotic maximum size across the metapopulation and $k$ is the growth rate. We estimated the parameters from the slope $m$ and y-intercept $b$ of the relationship between the length at first capture $L_t$ and the length at a later capture date $L_{t+1}$ for fish recaught a year later (within 345 to 385 days). The von Bertalanffy parameters are $k = -\ln(m)$ and $L_\infty = b(1-m)$ \citep{hart2009estimating} (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}, uncertainty details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}).

% From the slope $m = e^{(-K)}$ and y-intercept $b = L_\infty[1 - e^{(-K)}]$, we calculated the von Bertalanffy parameters, such that $K = -\ln m$ and $L_\infty = \frac{b}{(1-m)}$ \citep{hart2009estimating}. We used the first and second capture lengths for fish that were recaught after a year (within 345 to 385 days) to estimate $L_\infty$ and $K$. For fish recaptured more than once, we randomly selected only one recapture period from each to use to estimate the von Bertalanffy parameters and repeated the random selection and estimate 1000 times. We found the mean estimates ($L_\infty$ = 10.70 cm, $K = 0.864$) and mean standard error of those fits, then sampled from within that range to generate a set of von Bertalanffy growth curves to use in our LEP calculations (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}, \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Growth_and_survival}). 

We used the full set of marked fish to estimate annual survival $\phi$ and probability of recapture $p_r$ using the mark-recapture program MARK implemented in R through the package \texttt{RMark} \citep{RMark_Laake2013}. We fit several models with year, size, and patch effects on the probability of survival on a log-odds scale and selected the model with the lowest $\text{AIC}_c$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}c, details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Growth_and_survival}, uncertainty details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}, and full list of models in Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_MARKmodels}). % The model chosen by $\text{AIC}_c$ indicated that survival differed among patches and increased with fish size (Tables \ref{APP_TAB_Params}, \ref{APP_TAB_SiteSurvivals}, Figs.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}c, \ref{APP_FIG_SurvBySizeAndSite}, uncertainty details in SI \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty_Survival}). 

\paragraph*{Fecundity}

From a regression of eggs per clutch on female size while accounting for egg age (determined by the presence of eyed eggs), we found that fecundity increased with size (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{EQN_Fec}, see details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Fecundity}). We only considered reproductive effort for female fish. For sex transition size $L_f$, we used the average size at which recaptured fish were first observed as female (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}d, uncertainty details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}).


% %% MOVE THE REST OF THE FECUNDITY SECTION TO SUPPLEMENT!
% We used a size-dependent fecundity relationship determined using photos of egg clutches and females \citep{yawdoszynInPrepfecundity}, where the number of eggs per clutch ($E_c$) is exponentially related to the length in cm of the female ($L$) with size effect $\beta_l = 2.388$, intercept $b = 1.174$, and egg age effect $\beta_e = -0.608$ dependent on if the eggs are old enough to have visible eyes. We multiplied the number of eyed eggs per clutch by the number of clutches per year $c_e = 11.9$ \citep[estimate from][]{holtswarth2017fecundity} to get total annual fecundity $f$ of a female of length $L$:

% \begin{equation}
% f = c_e * e^{\beta_l\ln(L) + \beta_e[\text{eyed}] + b}. \label{EQN_Fec}
% \end{equation}

% \begin{equation} % is this the best way of writing this?
% \ln(E_c) = \beta_l\ln(L) + \beta_e[\text{eyed}] + b. \label{EQN_Fec}
% \end{equation}
% To get total annual fecundity $f$, we multiply the number of eyed eggs per clutch by the number of clutches per year $c_e = 11.9$, using the estimate from \cite{holtswarth2017fecundity}.

% For comparison of numbers (from Clownfish\_SP\_Notes:) Moyer (1986): the individual observed for 11 years and thought to live to at least 13 was ”estimated to have contributed about 160,000 propagules in its lifetime,” spent 3 years as a functional male, then outlived 3 mates as a female; fertilized about 45,000 eggs during 3 years as a male, then spawned about 115,000 eggs as a female; fecundity estimate at this site (Miyake-jima in Japan) is 17,500 eggs/yr/female (from Bell (1976))

\paragraph*{Lifetime egg production (LEP)}

We used an integral projection model (IPM) \citep{ellner2016data} with size as the continuous structuring trait $L$ to estimate lifetime egg production on each patch $i$ ($\text{LEP}_i$). We initialized the IPM with one recruit-sized individual (recruit defined in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Recruit_def}) at the initial annual time step ($t=0$), then projected forward for 100 years. We used the size- and site-dependent survival (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{APP_EQN_Survival}) and growth (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}) functions as the probability density functions in the kernel to project the individual into the next time step, producing a size distribution across time ($v_{L,t}$). We then multiplied by size-dependent fecundity $f_L$ (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{EQN_Fec}). Integrating across time and size, from a minimum size $L_s=0$ cm to a maximum $U_s=15$ cm, gave us the total number of eggs one recruit produced in its lifetime (details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_LEP}, uncertainty details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}):

% We used an integral projection model (IPM) \citep{ellner2016data} with size as the continuous structuring trait $L$ to estimate lifetime egg production on each patch $i$ ($\text{LEP}_i$). We initialized the IPM with one recruit-sized individual (recruit defined in SI \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Recruit_def}) at the initial annual time step ($t=0$), then projected forward for 100 years. We used the size- and site-dependent survival (eqn.\ \ref{APP_EQN_Survival}) and growth (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}) functions as the probability density functions in the kernel to project the individual into the next time step. The size distribution ($v_L$) at each time step represents the probability that the individual has survived and grown into each of the possible size categories, ranging from a minimum of $L_s=0$ cm to a maximum of $U_s=15$ cm divided into 100 equal size bins. %The probability that the individual is still alive and of any size decreases as the time steps progress; by using a large number of steps, we are able to avoid arbitrarily setting a maximum age and instead let the probabilities become essentially zero. %($\text{size}_\text{recruit}$) 

% We then multiplied the size-distribution $v_{L,t}$ at each time by the size-dependent fecundity $f_L$ (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_Fec}) to get the total number of eggs produced at each time step. Integrating across time and size gave the total number of eggs one recruit produced in its lifetime (details in \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_LEP}, uncertainty details in SI \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}): % We only considered reproductive effort once the fish was female and used the average size of first female observation for recaptured fish as the transition size ($L_f = 9.32$ cm). Moved this up to fecundity section.

\begin{equation}
\text{LEP} = \int_{t=0}^{\infty}\int_{L=L_s}^{L=U_s} v_{L,t} f_L dL dt. \label{EQN_LEP}
\end{equation}

We calculated LEP by patch ($\text{LEP}_i$) and averaged across patches ($\text{LEP}_*$) for a fish of recruit size. We also calculated LEP for a fish of parent size (6.0 cm) averaged across patches (LEPp), which is used below to estimate egg-recruit survival.

\paragraph*{Accounting for density dependence}  % Should this be its own section or part of the survival from egg to recruit?

We would ideally assess persistence when the population is at low abundance and not limited by density dependence; at high density the population growth rate will slow to zero. Density dependence is particularly clear in anemonefish. Juveniles will prevent others from settling such that each anemone can house only one recently settled anemonefish \citep{buston2003forcible}. This density-dependent mortality reduces the apparent survival of new recruits from our field measurements. We accounted for this effect by scaling up our estimate of recruits (the numerator of eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}, described next) by the proportional increase ($\text{D}$) in unoccupied anemones if all of the anemones occupied by yellowtail anemonefish were unoccupied, where $p_A$ is the proportion of anemones occupied by yellowtail anemonefish and $p_U$ is the proportion of unoccupied anemones: $\text{D} = \frac{(p_U + p_A)}{p_U}$. We present results with this density dependence modification in the main text and without the modification in the appendix (with subscript D, Appendix Figs.\ \ref{APP_FIG_LRP_LocalReplacement_noDD}, \ref{APP_FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat_noDD}). % DD = 1.81

\paragraph*{Survival from egg to recruit ($S_e$)}

We estimated survival from egg to recruit ($S_e$) using parentage matches to find the number of surviving recruits produced by genotyped parents \citep[similar to][]{johnson2018integrating}. However, the number of offspring we assigned back to parents ($R_m$) is an underestimate of the offspring produced by genotyped parents because it is impossible to sample exhaustively. To account for unsampled offspring, we divided $R_m$ by four factors (described below and with details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_ScalingUpRecruits} and Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_RecruitScalingSchematic}), in addition to multiplying by $\text{D}$ as described above, then divided by the number of eggs produced by genotyped parents:

\begin{equation}
S_e = \frac{\frac{D R_m}{P_h P_c P_d P_s}}{N_g \text{LEP}_p}, \label{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}
\end{equation}

where $N_g$ was the number of genotyped parents and $\text{LEP}_p$ was the expected lifetime egg production for a fish that has already survived to parent size $p$ (=6.0cm). $P_h$ was the cumulative proportion of habitat in our patches that we sampled over time, $P_c$ was the probability of capturing a fish if we sampled its anemone, $P_d$ was the proportion of the total dispersal kernel from each of our patches covered by our sampling region, and $P_s$ was the proportion of suitable habitat in our sampling region (details in for each in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_ScalingUpRecruits}, uncertainty of $P_c$ in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}).
% We scaled the number of matched recruits by the cumulative proportion of habitat in our sites we sampled over time ($P_h = 0.41$, details in \ref{APP_SEC_ProbHabSampled}), the probability of capturing a fish if we sampled its anemone ($P_c = 0.56$, see \ref{APP_SEC_ProbR} for details), and the proportion of the total dispersal kernel area from each of our sites covered within our sampling region ($P_d =0.57$, calculation in \ref{APP_SEC_PropDispKernelSampled}). Finally, because our dispersal kernel gives the probability of dispersal given that a recruit settled somewhere but our sampling region is not all habitat, we scaled by the proportion habitat in our sampling region ($P_s = 0.20$, details in \ref{APP_SEC_PropHabInSampledRegion}) to avoid counting mortality from settling on non-habitat twice. %P_d was previously 0.57

To estimate the survival and retention of recruits back to our patches (needed for local replacement, LR, eqn. \ref{EQN_LR}), we scaled only by $P_h$ and $P_c$: 

\begin{equation}
R_e = \frac{\frac{D R_m}{P_h P_c}}{N_g \text{LEP}_p}. \label{EQN_Re}
\end{equation}

% We considered uncertainty in the number of offspring assigned to parents during the parentage analysis ($R_m$) and in the probability of capturing a fish ($P_c$). We generated a set of values for the number of assigned offspring using a random binomial, with the number of genotyped offspring (745) as the number of trials and the assignment rate from the parentage analysis (0.079) as the probability of success on each trial \citep{catalanoInPrepconnectivity}. For the probability of capturing a fish, we sampled values from a beta distribution that captures the mean and variance of capture probabilities across recapture dives (details in \ref{APP_EQN_ProbCapBetaDistParams}).

% \paragraph*{Defining recruit and census stage} 

% When assessing persistence, we must consider mortality and reproduction that occurs across the entire life cycle to determine whether an individual is replacing itself with an individual that reaches the same life stage \citep{burgess2014beyond}. We define a recruit to be a juvenile individual that has settled on the reef within the previous year, which also encompasses the size we are first able to sample (3.5-6.0 cm for parentage studies) (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Schematic}). In theory, it does not matter how we define a recruit as long as we use that definition in our calculations of both egg-recruit survival and LEP. In our system, however, while it is straightforward to calculate LEP from any size, we did not have enough tagged recruits to reliably estimate survival to different recruit sizes. Instead, we choose the mean size of offspring matched in the parentage study as our best estimate of the size of a recruit ($\text{size}_\text{recruit}$) and tested sensitivity to different recruit sizes by sampling from a uniform distribution over the sizes the recruit stage covers (3.5-6 cm, Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}).

\subsection*{Estimated abundance over time} %%%%% COME BACK AND EDIT/CHECK THIS SECTION!!!%%%%%%%

We examined trends in abundance of breeding females at each patch over time ($F_{i,t}$) to compare to our replacement-based persistence estimates. As with offspring, we scaled up the number of females caught ($F_{c_{i,t}}$) at each patch $i$ in each sampling year $t$ by the proportion of habitat sampled in that patch and year ($P_{h_{i,t}}$) and by the probability of capturing a fish $P_c$:
\begin{equation}
F_{i,t} = \frac{F_{c_{i,t}}}{P_{h_{i,t}}P_c}
%\text{\# females}_{i,t} = \frac{\text{\# females captured}_{i,t}}{P_{h_{i,t}}P_c}. \label{EQN_FemaleAbundance}
\end{equation}

We fit a mixed effects model with Poisson errors in which $F_{i,t}$ was the response variable, year was the fixed effect, and there were random effects by patch for both intercept and slope using the package \texttt{lme4} in R \citep{lme42015package}.
% We fit a mixed effects model to estimate the number of fish in each year as a Poisson-distributed variable $\lambda_a$ with random effects by patch for both intercept and slope through time using the package \texttt{lme4} in R \citep{lme42015package}.

% \begin{equation} \label{EQN_Abundance}
% \begin{split}
% F_{i,0} & \sim Poisson(\lambda_a) \\
% F_{i,t} & = (\lambda_a + m_i)m_t t.
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}

%We estimated $\lambda_a$ for an average patch as well as the individual patchs. %The population is increasing over time if $\lambda_a > 1$ and decreasing if $\lambda_a < 1$.
%We fit a mixed effects model to with site as a random effect, estimating the number of fish in each year using the package \texttt{lme4} in R \citep{lme42015package} to assess whether the population trend over time at an average site, as well as the individual sites, is positive or negative. We estimate the number of fish in each year as a Poisson variable with random effects

% \begin{equation}
% %\text{\# females} = m*\text{year} + b. \label{EQN_AbundanceLM}  % There has got to be a better way to write this!
% %\text{\# females}_i \sim \text{year}  % This was what was in the June draft
% \end{equation}

\subsection*{Exploring alternative geographies and larval navigation}

To understand whether results would likely be similar in other geographies, we tested the sensitivity of metapopulation persistence to alternative patch widths and to the proportion of the region that is habitat. We varied the proportion of habitat and the overall width of the region using 19 equally sized and spaced patches. We created connectivity matrices using the new distances between patches and otherwise used the original parameter values and uncertainty sets, using adult survival ($\phi$) from the patch with median survival (the Elementary School patch) for all patches.

We also tested sensitivity to the ability of larvae to navigate to habitat by adding up to a 1 km buffer to the edges of the destination patches when integrating the dispersal kernel and adjusting the scaling parameter $P_s$ (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}) to account for fewer larvae being lost between patches (details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Larval_nav}).

% % For our persistence metrics, we present the estimate using the demographic and connectivity input values without uncertainty (the mean of the uncertainty distributions, with the exception of the size range for recruit), as the best estimate and the range with uncertainty shown in brackets.

% We calculated an average value of LEP across sites of 721 eggs [82, 31657] (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}b), with values at individual sites that ranged from 0 to 1754 eggs. Uncertainty in adult survival had the largest effect on LEP (Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP}), which corresponds to longer-surviving individuals having more opportunities to reproduce at larger sizes. 

% We estimated egg-recruit survival $S_{e_{DD}}$ to be 0.002 [3.5e-05, 0.014] when we correct for density-dependence in our data. Uncertainty in the size of transition to breeding female $L_f$ had the largest effect on egg-recruit survival (Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_RperE}); the larger the transition size to female, the fewer tagged eggs we estimate were produced by our genotyped parents and the higher our estimate of egg-recruit survival. This differs from our finding above that adult survival had the largest effect on LEP because the starting size of the individual considered is lower when we estimate LEP for a recruit (4.37 cm, 3.5-6.0cm range) than LEP for a parent (6.0cm). Fish considered parents in our parentage analysis have already survived one or more years since recruiting so the transition to breeding female plays a larger role in the number of eggs they are likely to produce than for fish who have just recruited.

\subsection*{Demographic rates}

% From field data, mark-recapture, and parentage analyses, we estimated growth, annual survival, and egg-recruit survival. We found an average asymptotic maximum size $L_\infty$ of 10.7 cm, with a growth rate $k = 0.86$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, details in SI \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Growth}). Annual survival varied by patch and was higher for larger fish (Figs.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}c and \ref{APP_FIG_SurvBySizeAndSite}, Table \ref{APP_TAB_SiteSurvivals}, details in SI \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Survival}). Average lifetime egg production across patches ($\text{LEP}_*$) was 827 [227, 2919] (Figs.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}a, \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP}, details in SI \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_LEP}). Egg-recruit survival was 0.002 [0.0005, 0.01] (Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_RperE}, details in SI \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Egg-recruit_survival}). \cite{catalanoInPrepconnectivity} estimated the dispersal kernel we used, finding a mean dispersal distance of 8.15 km (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}a, SI \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Dispersal}).

From field data, mark-recapture, and parentage analyses, we estimated growth (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Growth}), fecundity (Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Fecundity}), annual survival (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}c, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SurvBySizeAndSite}, Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Survival}), lifetime egg production (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}a, Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_LEP}), egg-recruit survival (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_RperE}, Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Egg-recruit_survival}), and the dispersal kernel (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}a, Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Dispersal}). Details and estimated values are in the Results (Appendix B) and Tables (Appendix C) sections of the appendix. These demographic rates form the basis for assessing whether and how the metapopulation persists.

Details and estimated values are in Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params} and SI \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS}.

\subsection*{Persistence metrics}

Using our demographic and dispersal results, we estimated average lifetime recruit production (LRP) across patches to be 1.74 [0.93, 5.57] (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}b, Appedix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP_R}). Best estimates of $\text{LRP}_i$ at individual patches ranged from 0 to 3.7 (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_PatchSpecificLEPandLRP}, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_LRPbySite}). Averaged across patches, 95\% of LRP estimates were $\geq 1$, which means that individuals produced enough offspring to replace themselves. However, LRP does not tell us whether those offspring settled in locations that contributed to persistence.

% For demographic inputs to the persistence metrics, we found that average asymptotic maximum size ($L_\infty$) was 10.70, and annual survival increased with fish size and varied across patches (Figs.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}c, \ref{APP_FIG_SurvBySizeAndSite}). We estimated average lifetime recruit production (LRP) across patches to be 1.45 with uncertainty bounds of 0.62-7.78 (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}c) and best estimates of $\text{LRP}_{i}$ at individual patches ranging from 0 to 3.5. Averaged across patches, 94\% of LRP estimates were $\geq 1$. This means that individuals produced enough surviving offspring to be able to replace themselves. However, LRP does not tell us whether those offspring settled within our sample patches and contributed to persistence. 

Considering retention of larvae at individual patches, we did not find any patches with $\text{SP}_{i} \geq 1$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat}a), suggesting that no patch could persist in isolation. The Haina patch came closest to self-persistence ($\text{SP}_i = 0.088$ [0.009, 0.47]) and had 0.5\% of uncertainty values $ \geq 1$, making self-persistence very unlikely.. % The large uncertainty at Caridad Cemetery stems from the lack of recaptures of marked fish and therefore the high uncertainty in adult survival.

% Considering retention of larvae at individual patches, we did not find any patches with $\text{SP}_{i} \geq 1$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat}a), suggesting that no patch could persist in isolation. The Haina patch came closest to - but was still far from - self-persistence ($\text{SP}_i = 0.044$ [0.005, 0.23]). % The large uncertainty at Caridad Cemetery stems from the lack of recaptures of marked fish and therefore the high uncertainty in adult survival.

% Text when Haina had an uncertainty range that included >1 (before perc disp kernel sampled was corrected)
% We did not find any sites with a best estimate of $\text{SP}_{DD} \geq 1$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat}a), suggesting that none of our sites could persist in isolation. Though the site Haina ($\text{SP}_{DD}$ = 0.055 [2.6e-04, 1.27]) has an SP range that exceeds 1, only 0.1\% of the estimates are $\geq 1$, making self-persistence very unlikely. We also saw estimates $>$ 1 for Caridad Cemetery but those were due to the lack of recaptures at that site and the resulting high uncertainty in adult survival and are unlikely to indicate persistence. I %This suggests that Haina and Wangag could persist on their own at the upper limit of uncertainty in adult survival at the sites, but in general our results do not indicate that any site could perist in isolation. % We see the highest values of self-persistence at our two widest sites Haina (0.13, [XX, XX]) and Wangag (0.082, [XX,XX]), compensating for density-dependence in our data (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat}a). 

% Most of the connectivity in the metapopulation occurred among the patches in the northern and southern areas, from Palanas to Caridad Cemetery and from Tomakin Dako to Sitio Baybayon (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat}b), where the patches tended to be larger, have higher abundances, and have higher survival (Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SurvBySizeAndSite}). The patches with the highest abundances were at the edges of the sampling region and had higher than average LRP so could have exported a substantial fraction of their offspring away the sampling region. % THINK MORE ABOUT WHAT TO SAY HERE!!

For network persistence, our estimate of $\lambda_{c}$ was 0.20 [0.11, 0.85], with 1.3\% of the estimates of $\lambda_c \geq 1$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat}c, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_NP}). Network persistence for this metapopulation was therefore highly unlikely but not impossible. Our estimate of local replacement (LR) was 0.20 [0.11, 0.64], also suggesting lack of independent persistence of this group of patches and very similar to our $\lambda_{c}$ estimate. While both LR and $\lambda_{c}$ provide information on the ability of our patches to persist as an isolated group, they differ in their assumption of the structure of the population. LR approximates the network of patches as a single well-mixed unit, while $\lambda_{c}$ incorporates the spatial structure of the patches and multi-generation dynamics. Results without density dependence compensation also suggested lack of persistence (Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_noDD}, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_LRP_LocalReplacement_noDD}).

% , with only a 0.5\% chance $\lambda_{c} \geq 1 = 0.005$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat}c). Network persistence for this metapopulation was therefore highly unlikely but not impossible. Our estimate of local replacement LR was 0.16 [0.07, 0.88], also suggesting lack of independent persistence of our group of patchess and very similar to our $\lambda_{c}$ estimate. While both LR and $\lambda_{c}$ provide information on the ability of our patches to persist as an isolated group, they differ in their assumption of the structure of the population. LR estimates the number of recruits individuals at our patches produced that settled within our patches, assuming the network of patches was a single well-mixed unit, while $\lambda_{c}$ incorporates the spatial structure and multi-generation dynamics. % THIS LAST SENTENCE FEELS LIKE IT SHOULD GO IN THE DISCUSSION BUT NOT SURE WHERE...  When we calculated LR using all arriving recruits to our sites, however, rather than just those originating there, our best estimate was $> 1$ (2.08 with 99.8\% estimates $\geq 1$), suggesting that there is recruit-recruit replacement at our sites when we include immigrants. 

\subsection*{Abundance}

Our estimated abundance of females over time had a positive trend for the average patch (slope = 1.08, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}a), suggesting a slight increase in population size through time. Most individual patches also showed a positive trend in female abundance through time (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}a, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_AbundanceBySite}). Therefore, though the metapopulation did not exhibit network persistence, it also did not show signs of decline over the time scale of our study. 

% This was further confirmed when we calculated LR using all recruits arriving to our patches, rather than just those originating there, assessing whether there was replacement with immigrants included. LR with immigrants gave a best estimate $> 1$ (2.08 with 99.8\% estimates $\geq 1$), also suggesting that there was recruit-recruit replacement for the metapopulation when outside recruits were included.  %% INCLUDE THIS SENTENCE ABOUT LR WITH ALL RECRUITS HERE OR IN THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE?

% Lack of persistence of our sites as a group is also confirmed by our estimate of local replacement ($\text{LR}_{DD}$), which estimates replacement for recruits from our sites returning to our sites, implictly including dispersal, is 0.16 [0.05, 0.76] when we correct for density-dependence in our data. With a value well below one, this suggests individuals at our sites do not replace themselves with recruits that settle in our sites, and that our sites do not persist as an independent network. When we calculated LR using all arriving recruits to our sites, however, rather than just those originating there, our best estimate was $> 1$ (2.06 with XX\% > 1), suggesting that there is recruit-recruit replacement at our sites when we include immigrant recruits.

\subsection*{Alternative production and geographies}

We then examined what conditions would be needed for this metapopulation to reach persistence. With the existing patch configuration and dispersal kernel, the system would need $\text{LRP} \geq 8.4$ (a five-fold increase) to reach network persistence. In turn, this would require a five-fold increase of egg-recruit survival ($S_e$) or $\text{LEP}_*$ or an equivalent combination of increases across both. If we alternatively considered all arriving recruits as offspring (not just those originating within the metapopulation), LRP would be 11.1, which would be sufficient for persistence. Similarly, our estimate of LR using all recruits arriving to the patches gave an estimate $> 1$ (2.21), also suggesting there was recruit-recruit replacement for the metapopulation when immigrants were included. 

 % NP estimate > 1 when perc_hab = 0.86, 634 runs >= 1 at 0.9 perc hab
Another route to persistence would be with a different dispersal matrix or habitat density. If dispersal was such that the metapopulation retained all offspring produced, the study region would be persistent because $\text{LRP} > 1$. With the observed dispersal, however, retaining all recruits is difficult to achieve. The coastline had a low fraction of habitat (20\%) and would need to be increased to about 85\% before enough offspring are retained that the point estimate of $\lambda_c \geq 1$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}a). In contrast, widening the region while maintaining the same habitat density (20\%) did not achieve persistence (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}b) unless habitat density was also increased (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}c). As the region widens, the habitat density necessary for persistence decreases, down to 69\% habitat at a region of 50 km. In contrast, allowing for larval navigation had little impact on persistence estimates (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}d).

% Another route to persistence would be with a different dispersal matrix. If essentially all recruits produced from our patches landed on one of the outher patches (i.e., none lost to sandy areas between patches or to habitat beyond our study region), the metapopulation would be network persistent because $\text{LRP} \geq 1$. With the observed dispersal pattern, however, retaining all recruits is difficult to achieve. The coastline had a low fraction of habitat (20\%), but increasing this even to 100\% did not achieve network persistence with certainty ($\lambda_c = 0.95$, with only 59\% of the estimates $\geq 1$, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}a). Essentially all of the offspring produced by the metapopulation need to be retained for a best estimate of persistence, and even with 100\% habitat, many were exported outside of the region. Widening the region at the same habitat density also did not contribute to persistence (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}b), but persistence became likely for a wider region of 100\% habitat (best estimate $>1$ at about 33 km, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}c). Allowing for larval navigation hardly changed our persistence estimates (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}d), as the larger effective area of each patch was essentially offset by removing that area from the scaling that accounted for larval losses to non-habitat ($P_s$ in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}).

% Old text from when
%Alternately, increasing the amount of habitat in our region (currently about 20\%) to 55\%, with equally sized and spaced sites with adult survival of an average site, gives a best estimate of $\lambda_{c_{DD}} = 1$ and suggests network persistence (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WI_PERC_HAB}a). Considering uncertainty, 95\% of the estimates of $\lambda_{c_{DD}}$ are $> 1$ at about 85\% habitat (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WI_PERC_HAB}b).

% Our estimated abundance of females over time has a slight positive trend for the average site ($m_t = 1.08$, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}a), suggesting a slight increase in population size for the population overall through time. Most individual sites also show a slight positive trend in female abundance through time, though one large site shows declines (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}a, Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_AbundanceBySite}s). %COME BACK AND CHECK AND DEAL WITH THIS!

\section*{Discussion}

In this first assessment of demographic persistence of a coastal marine metapopulation, we did not find strong evidence for either self-persistence of an individual patch or network persistence of the entire 30 km area as an isolated region. This inability to persist as an isolated region does not mean that the metapopulation was declining, however. Both population trends and replacement of recruits with immigrants showed that population levels were stable or increasing slightly. Taken together, these metrics suggest that the region required input of immigrants to persist. Despite encompassing a distance substantially larger than mean dispersal, the coastline only persisted as part of a larger metapopulation.

Theory for predicting persistence within patchy habitats has suggested that we expect self-persistence when the mean dispersal distance is small relative to patch size and network persistence in groups of patches when dispersal distances are much larger than patch sizes and where the proportion of habitat in the landscape is about 10-40\% \citep[depending on the particular species, population, and maximum reproductive rate,][]{botsford2019population}. Individual patches in the focal metapopulation were too small for self-persistence, but the 30 km region we sampled was about triple the mean dispersal distance of yellowtail anemonefish estimated from previous genetic work \citep[8-9 km,][]{pinsky2010using, catalanoInPrepconnectivity}. Rather than a continuous patch, however, the region was only about 20\% habitat. Low habitat may result at least in part from habitat declines over recent decades, based on interviews with fishers in the early 2000s (Jennifer Selgraeth, pers.\ comm.). Increasing the proportion of coastline with habitat in sensitivity tests, however, suggested that even 40\% habitat coverage would not be sufficient to achieve persistence and this metapopulation would require almost continuous habitat to persist. Similar to fish on small patches in the Caribbean \citep{johnson2018integrating}, this anemonefish metapopulation depends on the production and connectivity of outside patches. One possible path to persistence would be through nearby patches with higher egg production or survival. In such a case, even a small increase in area could create a persistent network. Deeper reefs, for example, are often healthier than shallower reefs \citep{cinner2016bright}. In this system, offshore reefs at Cuatro Islas or the Camotes Islands, for example, with higher coral cover and less silt, could have higher anemonefish survival and contribute disproportionately to regional metapopulation persistence. %; $\text{LRP}_i$ is highest at our deepest patch, Tomakin Dako

% From theory for predicting persistence within marine protected areas, we expect persistence in patches with a length at least twice the mean dispersal distance \citep[e.g.][]{lockwood2002effects} or from a network of patches when at least 35\% of the coastline is habitat \citep{botsford2001dependence}. Our individual patches were likely too small for self-persistence but the 30 km region we sampled was more than twice the mean dispersal distance of yellowtail anemonefish estimated from previous genetic work \citep[9 km,][]{pinsky2010using} and our samples \citep[8.2 km,][]{catalanoInPrepconnectivity}. Rather than a continuous patch, however, the region was only about 20\% habitat and experienced declines in habitat extent and quality in recent decades (fishers noticed habitat changes when asked in the early 2000s, Jennifer Selgreth, pers.\ comm.). Poor habitat quality limited persistence; even 100\% habitat did not guarantee network persistence in our sensitivity test, unless the region was also larger. Low production means that the area required for the larger persistent metapopulation \cite[like][estimated in their system]{johnson2018integrating} depends on the production and connectivity of outside patches. If surrounding patch populations had a similar LRP and level of connectivity as our patches, increasing the area of the network to include them would not achieve network persistence, as seen in our simulation of a wider region with the sampling region habitat density and quality. If nearby patches had higher egg production or survival, however, a small increase in area could create a persistent network. Nearby reef patches such as Cuatro Islas, for example, with higher coral cover and less silt, could have had higher survival and contributed recruits to our patches.

Nearby reef patches such as Cuatro Islas, for example, with higher coral cover and less silt, could have had higher survival and contributed recruits to our patches. 

Our finding of a lack of isolated persistence differs markedly from persistence findings of other reef fish metapopulations. On reefs surrounding Kimbe Island, \cite{salles_coral_2015} report self-persistence of individual anemonefish subpopulations in lagoons that were of similar size (approximately 100-500 m long) to our individual patches, as well as network persistence of the 800 m wide metapopulation around the island. This persistence finding is at a dramatically smaller scale than for our focal metapopulation in the Philippines. Additionally, \cite{johnson2018integrating} estimated that four reefs of a combined area of only 2.6 $\text{km}^2$ (four 65 ha patches) would be sufficient for network persistence of a damselfish metapopulation across multiple islands in the Bahamas. This area is roughly equivalent to a 26 km coastline section, which is shorter than our sampling region. To persist, these two offshore metapopulations either had much higher retention of recruits or higher LRP than did our coastline patches. 

Though lack of sufficient connectivity and retention is thought to inhibit network persistence in some systems \citep[e.g., insufficient retention of offspring within reserves for eastern oysters (\textit{Crassostrea virginica}) in North Carolina;][]{puckett2016metapopulation}, low production of surviving recruits seems the likelier explanation in the Philippines. Recruit production was lower in the Philippines than in the Kimbe Island populations, where \cite{salles2020strong} estimated that an average individual produced 0.54 offspring over two years that recruited back to the natal population, more than twice our similar estimate of local replacement (LR = 0.20), which considered lifetime rather than biennial production of locally-recruiting offspring. Lower production at our patches could be due to lower egg production, slower growth, or lower adult survival, all likely affected by habitat quality \citep[e.g.][]{salles2020strong, hayashi2019low}. Our study system was near a populated coastline and experienced anthropogenic effects, including pollution and silt, that can reduce demographic rates. Adult survival, for example, was lower at the two patches just downstream of a gravel mine (N. and S. Magbangon). Even at our higher-survival patches (38\% annual survival for a 6 cm fish and 53\% for a 10 cm fish at Tomakin Dako, for example), survival was lower than estimates from the populations at Kimbe Island \citep[85\% annual survival,][]{salles_coral_2015}. Estimates of annual survival in other reef fish species are closer to the lower survival we found for yellowtail anemonefish than the higher survival of \textit{A. percula} at Kimbe Island \citep[approximately 30\% annual survival for bluehead wrasse (\textit{Thalassoma bifasciatum}) and bicolour damselfish (\textit{Stegastes partitus}), respectively;][]{warner1988population, figueira2008small}. Metapopulation studies in other reef fish \citep[e.g.,][]{figueira2009connectivity} and marine species more broadly \citep{carson2011evaluating} are highly sensitive to adult survival and other demographic parameters.

Temporal variability in demographic or dispersal parameters on a time scale longer than our sampling could also enable persistence of our patches in isolation \citep[similar to the storage effect,][]{warner1985coexistence} rather than as part of a larger metapopulation. Successful recruitment events on the decadal scale, for example, sustain rockfish populations on the west coast of the United States through the intervening weak recruitment years \citep[e.g.][]{tolimieri2005roles}. Our study could have missed a particularly strong recruitment event driven by variable ocean connectivity \citep[simulations suggest that 20 years are necessary to capture the full extent of ocean variability in the Coral Triangle region surrounding our patches;][]{thompson2018variability}. Strong recruitment would need to occur at least once a generation to maintain patch populations without switching to colonization and extinction dynamics, however, which we do not see. Our study likely spans the generation time of a yellowtail anemonefish (roughly 5 years) so variable strong recruitment, while possible, is unlikely to sustain our populations.

Understanding marine population persistence in the context of broader metapopulation theory requires reconciling replacement-based persistence analysis with classic colonization-extinction and source-sink dynamics \citep{sale2006merging}. At the patch level, many marine metapopulations do not exhibit the colonization-extinction dynamics \citep[or do only on a decades to centuries timescale,][]{smedbol2002myths} that underpin our understanding of many terrestrial metapopulations \citep[e.g,][]{hanski1998metapopulation, moilanen1998long} and instead consist of continuously-occupied patches connected by dispersal \citep{kritzer2006marine}. Because dispersal is so widespread, patches in marine systems are not easily classified as sources or sinks in the classical fashion \citep{figueira2006defining, white2011oceanographic}. For example, despite being unable to persist in isolation, our region is not technically a sink \citep{pulliam1988sources} because LRP $> 1$. For metapopulations, lack of self-persistence can have two causes: reproduction does not balance mortality losses within a patch (a sink) or sufficient recruits are produced but not retained (as we found in the Philippines). Metapopulations likely lie on a continuum between extinction-colonization dynamics and exchange among populated patches \citep{kritzer2006marine} but the latter many be a more practical approach to characterizing dynamics for metapopulations in which exchange is frequent relative to organisms' generations times \citep{hastings_persistence_2006}. %Dispersal that leads to demographic exchange rather than colonization is not commonly considered in classic metapopulation dynamics, though there have been some attempts to consider all successful offspring from a patch and not just those retained locally when classifying sources and sinks \citep{figueira2006defining}.

%%% Delete for now, retain in case a reviewer asks
% Our sampling on patchy coral reefs was designed for mark-recapture analysis rather than a comprehensive habitat or abundance census, so though we accounted for uneven sampling, we could have missed population declines if the underlying habitat was shifting. We used tagged anemones to account for unvisited patch habitat, but tags with missing anemones are harder to find. If anemones disappeared over time at our patches, we could have overestimated the number of fish and missed population declines indicating lack of persistence even with outside input. These scaling challenges are not unique to our study: few ecological studies are full censuses through time, and marine metapopulations tend to be patchy and heterogeneous \citep[e.g. coral reefs, the intertidal zone, and kelp forests;][]{saenz2011connectivity, johnson2001metapopulation, castorani_connectivity_2015}, where individuals are not well-mixed across space or time. In these cases, carefully considering how sampling interacts with distribution, properly accounting for such uncertainties, and characterizing uncertainty in parameter estimates, is an important part of persistence estimation.

In this system and others, density dependence presents a sampling challenge. Persistence criteria \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, burgess2014beyond} ask whether a population at low abundance can grow and recover rather than going extinct. In real populations, however, it can be challenging to estimate density-independent demographic rates because density dependence is occurring in the population as it is sampled during dispersal \citep{nowicki2011evidence} and reproduction \citep{rodenhouse2003multiple}. In anemonefish, density dependence is likely most important immediately post-settlement, as it is for many species, including corals, trees, and butterflies \citep{vermeij2008density, harms2000pervasive, nowicki2009relative}. However, density dependence could continue to be important throughout life due to social hierarchies in anemonefish colonies \citep{buston2011determinants}. Our calculations of persistence in this paper did not account for longer term post-settlement density dependence, which would be an interesting area of further research.

% Density dependence also presents a sampling challenge. Persistence criteria \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, burgess2014beyond} ask whether a population at low abundance can grow and recover rather than going extinct.

To avoid competition within the colony, fish in the pre-reproductive queue may have lower growth and survival than fish alone on an anemone \citep{buston2003social, buston2003forcible}, suggesting higher growth and survival, and therefore LRP, in the absence of density dependence. Our calculations of self-persistence in this paper did not account for post-settlement density dependence, which would be an interesting area of further research.

%%%%% OLD CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH BEFORE MALIN/WILL EARLY AUGUST EDITS
Understanding persistence is critical for the management of spatial populations, such as siting marine protected areas \citep{kaplan_model-based_2009}, assessing habitat fragmentation risks \citep{smith2002population, fahrig2001much} and conserving species in the face of climate change \citep{coleman2017anticipating, fuller2015persistence}. Though models and theory provide us with expectations, we are only beginning to tackle these questions empirically. Rules of thumb for understanding persistence that have been used broadly in marine ecology and conservation over the past two decades may not apply to every study system, as we have found. Fortunately, tools now exist to permit a more precise evaution of demographic rates that can enable assessment of persistence --- or lack thereof. Spatial scales of metapopulation persistence in marine systems are likely to be large, despite recently accuring evidence that dispersal distances are shorter than previously expected. Importantly, persistence of coastal metapopulations may rely on high quality habitat refugia to a greater extent than has been widely recognized.

With parentage analyses now being extended to temperate marine species \citep{baetscher2019dispersal} and a better understanding of how biophysical models compare to larval dispersal patterns \citep{bode2019validation}, we are beginning to move beyond model species and investigate persistence in harvested and spatially-managed systems \citep{garavelli2018population}. Our study shows the importance of long-term sampling and careful consideration of the demographic and sampling processes that affect persistence calculations in order to determine persistence mechanisms and assess persistence state to understand marine population dynamics in empirical systems.

% \section*{Discussion}
% % FIT THIS INTO DISCUSSION? 
% % MOVE TO DISCUSSION PER WILL'S COMMENT ON GOOGLE DOC! % The number of studies estimating demographic rates and connectivity in marine metapopulations is growing \citep[e.g.][]{carson2011evaluating, salles_coral_2015, johnson2018integrating, garavelli2018population}, but most use data from one or a few years. Longer data sets enable better estimates of long-term average rates, rather than assuming the demographic and dispersal rates from a particular year or two are representative. Long data sets are also useful for explicitly considering uncertainty, both to assess how well we understand persistence for a population and to assess which parameters contribute most to our uncertainty. Finally, sampling over many years provides abundance trends to compare with persistence metrics.

% In this first assessment of demographic persistence of a coastal marine metapopulation, we did not find strong evidence for either self-persistence of an individual patch or network persistence of the entire 30 km system as an isolated region. This inability to persist as an isolated region does not mean that the metapopulation is declining, however. Population trends - both abundance over time and replacement of recruits with immigrants included - find that population levels are stable or increasing slightly. Taken together, these metrics suggest that the region has a stable population on average but requires input of immigrants to persist. Despite encompassing a distance larger than mean dispersal, the coastline only persists as part of a larger metapopulation.

% For the anemonefish metapopulation to persist as an isolated network, either the number of surviving recruits produced by an average recruit (LRP) would need to be about six times higher (about XX) or more recruits would need to be retained within the region. This higher LRP value is similar to estimates of lifetime reproductive success that include dispersal to the natal reef in a clownfish on an isolated island \citep{salles2020strong}, suggesting it is not an unreasonable level of production. Habitat quality affects production in reef fishes \citep[e.g.,][]{salles2020strong, hayashi2019low}, and our study system is near a populated coastline and experiences anthropogenic effects, including pollution and silt from a riverbed gravel mine. Adult survival, for example, was lower at the two patches just downstream of the gravel mine (N.\ and S.\ Magbangon in Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SurvBySizeAndSite}), with impacts on $\text{LEP}i$ and therefore $\text{LRP}_i$. 

% Alternately, higher connectivity and retention of offspring among patches could lead to network persistence. Though lack of sufficient connectivity and retention is thought to inhibit network persistence in other systems \citep[e.g., a collection of reserves for eastern oysters (\textit{Crassostrea virginica}) in the Pamlico Sound in North Carolina;][]{puckett2016metapopulation}, low production of surviving recruits due to poor habitat quality seems the more likely explanation in our system. Our dispersal kernel is comparable to those estimated for other species of reef fish, both similar in shape \citep[e.g.,][]{harrison2012larval, daloia2015patterns} and with a mean dispersal distance of a similar range to that estimated for \textit{A. percula} in Kimbe Bay \citep[13.3 and 18.9 km compared to our estimate of 8.2 km;][]{almany2017larval}, which has been found to be persistent without input from outside reefs \citep{salles_coral_2015}. 

% % What-ifs, habitat amount
% We do not find clear evidence for network persistence despite estimates of the mean dispersal distance of \textit{A. clarkii} from previous genetic work \citep[9 km,][]{pinsky2010using} and from our samples \citep[8.2 km,][]{catalanoInPrepconnectivity} that are well within the 30 km span of our patches. The length of the metapopulation is more than twice the mean dispersal distance, usually sufficient for persistence of a population in an isolated habitat patch \citep[e.g.,][]{lockwood2002effects}. However, the metapopulation contains only about 20\% habitat, rather than a continuous stretch, which may be too low to support network persistence. Habitat quality and extent in our region has likely been declining in recent decades. The region was hit in 2013 by Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest typhoons ever to make landfall, which destroyed reef habitat, including one of our northern sampling patchess. Fishers also noticed prior habitat changes when asked in the early 2000s (Jennifer Selgreth, pers. comm.). Finally, agriculture has spread over much of the steep mountain slopes immediately east of the metapopulation, possibly leading to extensive runoff over historical time and loss of reef habitat along this coastline. Our simulations suggests that even 100\% habitat in our sampling region does not guarantee network persistence.

% In addition, individual patches are too small to reach self-persistence. The largest patch, Haina, is only 0.8km wide, about 10 times smaller than the mean dispersal distance. This is in contrast to findings on isolated reefs surrounding Kimbe Island, however, where several anemonefish subpopulations in lagoons of similar size as our patches were found self-persistent \citep{salles_coral_2015}. The suggestion of a habitat shortage in our sampling region is partially dependent on our assumption that larvae land in non-habitat between patches and die. Larvae have some navigational and habitat-finding capabilities \citep[e.g.][]{elliott1995host, fisher2005swimming}, so we could be underestimating their ability to find habitat in our calculations, which would decrease the amount of habitat required for network persistence. % In our site with the highest LEP, a width of XX would be required for self-persistence.  COME BACK AND DEAL WITH LARVAL NAVIGATION AND THIS PARAGRAPH!!

% We suggest that this metapopulation is a sink area of a larger metapopulation but the area required for the larger persistent metapopulation depends on the production and connectivity of outside patches. If surrounding patch populations have a similar LRP and level of connectivity as our patches, increasing the area of the network to include them also would not achieve network persistence. If nearby patches have higher egg production or egg-recruit survival, however, it might not take much of an increase in area considered to create a persistent network. Nearby reef patches such as Cuatro Islas, for example, with higher coral cover and less silt, could have higher survival of fish and be contributing recruits to our patches. % COULD CONSIDER ADDING BIT ABOUT POLLUTION HERE INSTEAD OF IN LRP PARAGRAPH ABOVE. ANYTHING WE CAN SAY ABOUT THE SCALE OF OTHER METAPOPS AS A COMPARISON?

% An alternative to our sampled patches existing as a sink portion of a larger metapopulation is that variability in demography or dispersal on a longer scale than our sampling time could lead to persistence \citep[similar to the storage effect,][]{warner1985coexistence} For example, rockfish on the west coast of the United States have highly variable and episodic recruitment, where successful recruitment events occur on the decadal scale and sustain the population until the next strong recruitment event \citep[e.g.,][]{tolimieri2005roles}. Though perhaps not as extreme as in the California Current system, ocean connectivity is still variable in the Coral Triangle region surrounding our study patches, with estimates suggesting that 20 year simulations are necessary to capture the full extent \citep{thompson2018variability}. Our study, though relatively long term, could have missed a particularly strong recruitment event that would enable local persistence of the set of populations we sampled. 

% Though we estimate abundance trends and do not find overall declines, it is possible we could have missed declines due to our sampling design. Our sampling study was designed for mark-recapture analyses rather than a comprehensive habitat or abundance estimate so we did not sample all areas of all patches each year. We scaled up the number of fish we caught to account for those we missed using the proportion of tagged anemones we visited, which assumes that all tagged anemones are equally likely to be sampled. In reality, tags that no longer have anemones next to them are likely harder to find and sample. If anemones are disappearing over time at our patches, we might be overestimating the number of fish present and missing population declines at our patches that would mean lack of persistence even with outside input. Properly accounting for such uncertainties, and characterizing uncertainty in our parameter estimates, is an important part of persistence estimation.

% % Including uncertainty in our empirical estimates of demographic and dispersal parameters allows us to better understand how likely it is that the population is persistent and which processes contribute the most uncertainty. We see a wide range of estimated metric values, spanning of network persistence for our set of sites to far from it. In our study, demographic parameters, particularly adult survival, have a large effect on whether or not we think the population is persistent. Other metapopulation studies also find higher sensitivity to demographic rather than connectivity parameters \citep[e.g., on source or sink status in bicolor damselfish;][]{figueira2009connectivity}, including particular sensitivity to adult survival \citep[on metapopulation growth rate in mussels;][]{carson2011evaluating}. Our estimates of connectivity are simpler than our estimates of demography, with no spatial variability \citep[which can be important in understanding demographic connectivity;][]{johnson2018integrating}, and a more thorough assessment could alter their relative effect on persistence, but this suggests that sufficient offspring production and survival has a larger effect on persistence at these relatively small scales of connectivity. Uncertainty in our sampling, particularly how likely we are to capture a fish, however, contributes the most uncertainty to whether we determine the population to be persistent, highlighting the challenge of estimating these metrics empirically. For a marine metapopulation, our system is relatively uncomplicated; as we accumulate more empirical assessments of metapopulations to compare to our expectations from theory and models, we will have to think carefully about how to handle uncertainty as we move to tackling larger and more complicated systems.

% % Caveats - density-dependence
% Persistence criteria \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, burgess2014beyond} ask whether a population at low abundance can grow and recover rather than going extinct. Density-dependence is often ignored at low abundances \citep{botsford2019population} so is not explicitly considered in persistence metrics. In real populations, however, it can be challenging to estimate density-independent demographic rates, as density-dependence is occurring in the population as it is sampled in processes such as dispersal \citep[e.g. in butterflies,][]{nowicki2011evidence} and fecundity \citep[e.g. in warblers,][]{rodenhouse2003multiple}. In yellowtail anemonefish, density dependence is likely most important immediately post-settlement, as it is for many species \citep[e.g. corals, trees, and butterflies:][]{vermeij2008density, harms2000pervasive, nowicki2009relative}, but could continue to be important throughout the life history due to social hierarchies in anemonefish colonies \citep[e.g.][]{buston2011determinants}. To avoid competition within the colony, fish in the pre-reproductive queue may have lower growth and survival than fish alone on an anemone \citep[seen in \textit{A. percula},][]{buston2003forcible, buston2003social}, suggesting higher growth and survival, and therefore LRP, in the absence of density-dependence.
% % %% CONDENSE INTO 1-2 SENTENCES, INCLUDE MORE DISCUSSION OF DD IN OTHER SYSTEMS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR PERSISTENCE MEASUREMENT (RIGHT NOW TOO FOCUSED ON RESULTS, NOT ENOUGH ON IMPLICATIONS)
% % Density-dependence could continue to be important throughout the life history, however, due to the social hierarchies in colonies of clownfish \citep[e.g.][]{buston2011determinants}. In other species of clownfish, individuals on the same anemone maintain strict size spacing, restricting their food intake and growth to avoid encroaching on the position of another fish and being attacked or evicted \citep[seen in \textit{A. percula},][]{buston2003forcible, buston2003social}. This suggests that while fish are in the pre-reproductive queue, density-dependence may lower growth rates compared to the growth of fish alone on an anemone, as would be the case in a population at low abundance. We include the primary effect of density-dependence on our estimate of egg-recruit survival but other estimates, particularly growth and survival, would also likely be higher in the absence of density-dependence and increase LRP.

% Understanding persistence is critical for the management of spatial populations, such as siting marine protected areas \citep[e.g.,][]{kaplan_model-based_2009}, assessing habitat fragmentation risks \citep[e.g.,][]{smith2002population, fahrig2001much} and conserving species in the face of climate change \citep[e.g.,][]{coleman2017anticipating, fuller2015persistence}. Though models and theory provide us with expectations, we are only recently beginning to be able to tackle these questions of persistence empirically in model systems such as clownfish and other sedentary tropical reef fish \citep[e.g.,][]{salles_coral_2015, johnson2018integrating}. With parentage analyses now being extended to temperate marine species \citep[e.g.,][]{baetscher2019dispersal} and a better understanding of how biophysical models compare to larval dispersal patterns \citep{bode2019validation} we are beginning to move beyond model species and investigate persistence in harvested and spatially-managed systems \citep[e.g.,][]{garavelli2018population}. Our study shows the importance of long term sampling and careful consideration of the different demographic processes that affect our metric calculations, such as density-dependence and sampling biases, to distinguish persistence ability from population trajectories and understand marine population dynamics in empirical systems.

{\LARGE Appendix}

% Hmm, they’re blank on my copy, too. I think one was about reformatting the table so that it was easier to read, perhaps including turning the page 90°, single-spacing, combining the best estimate and uncertainty columns (e.g., -2.33 [-2.81 to -1.22]), and using font size 11. The other comment was probably about creating one supplement, ordered into Supplemental Methods, Supplemental Results, Supplemental Tables, and Supplemental Figures.

% Order in main text: theory (lifetime recruit production, self-persistence, network persistence, local replacement), parentage analysis/dispersal kernel, growth and survival (mark-recap), fecundity, lifetime egg production, survival from egg to recruit, density-dependence, estimated abuncance over time, exploring alternative geographies and larval navigation

\subsection{Defining recruit and census stage} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_Recruit_def}

When assessing persistence, we must consider mortality and reproduction that occurs across the entire life cycle to determine whether an individual is replacing itself with an individual that reaches the same life stage \citep{burgess2014beyond}. We defined a recruit to be a juvenile individual that has settled on the reef within the previous year, which also encompasses the size of fish we were first able to sample (3.5--6.0 cm for parentage studies) (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Metric_life_cycle_schematics}e, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Schematic}). In theory, it does not matter how we defined recruit as long as we used the same definition in our calculations of both egg-recruit survival (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}) and LEP (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}). In our system, however, while it is straightforward to calculate LEP from any size, we did not have enough tagged recruits to reliably estimate survival from an egg to different recruit sizes. Instead, we chose the mean size of offspring matched in the parentage study as our best estimate of the size of a recruit ($\text{size}_\text{recruit} = 4.4$ cm) and tested sensitivity to different recruit sizes by sampling from a uniform distribution over the sizes the recruit stage covers (3.5--6.0 cm, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}, Appendix Figs.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP}-\ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_NP}).

\subsection{Self persistence (SP)} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_SP}

Our equation for SP (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_SP}) is a modification of that used in \cite{burgess2014beyond}, which uses LEP to represent offspring produced and local retention (the number of surviving recruits that disperse back to the natal patch divided by the number of eggs produced by the natal patch) to capture egg-recruit survival and dispersal combined: $\text{LEP } \text{x } \text{local retention} \geq 1$. We modify this to include egg-recruit survival in the offspring term instead, using LRP in place of LEP and probability of dispersal ($p_{i,i}$) in place of local retention.
 
%\subsection{Dispersal kernel} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_Dispersal}

\subsection{Growth and survival} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_Growth_and_survival}

To include size in the mark-recapture models for post-recruit survival ($\phi$) and recapture probability ($p_r$), we estimated sizes for fish in years when they were not recaptured. We used the growth model (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}) and the size recorded or estimated in the previous year to estimate the size of fish not recaptured in a particular year. Fish were not well-mixed at our patches, and divers needed to swim near an anemone to have a reasonable chance of capturing the fish on it. Therefore, we also included a distance effect on recapture probability (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{APP_EQN_MARK_Recapture}, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_MARKmodels}). We used diver GPS tracks to estimate the minimum distance between a diver and the anemone where the fish was first caught for each tagged fish in each sample year.

We compared the fit of the models using a modified version of the Akaike information criterion that reduces the potential for overfitting with small sample sizes (AICc) and selected the model with the lowest AICc value (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_MARKmodels}).

% Using diver GPS tracks, we estimated the minimum distance between a diver and the anemone for each tagged fish in each sample year to include as a factor. 

% From the mark-recapture analysis of tagged and genotyped fish, we estimate mean values of $L_\infty = 10.71 \text{cm}$ (range of estimates 10.50 - 10.90 cm) and $K = 0.864$ (range of estimates 0.785 - 0.944) for the von Bertalanffy growth curve parameters (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}). For juvenile and adult (post-recruitment) survival on a log-odds scale, the best-fit model has an effect of size, with coefficient $b_a = 0.169 \pm 0.028$ SE and intercept $b_\phi = -1.83 \pm 0.231$ SE (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_Survival}). The accompanying best-fit model for log-odds recapture probability has a negative size effect and a negative effect of diver distance from the anemone (eqn.\ \ref{APP_EQN_MARKRecapture}, Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_RecapSizeDistEffect}).

% \subsection{Breeding size} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_BreedingSize}

% We only considered reproduction during the female life stage of the fish. Fecundity was therefore 0 up to the size of transition from male to female ($L_f$) and then was size-dependent, described below (SI \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Fecundity}). We used the 

% We only considered reproductive effort once the fish is female and used the average size of first female observation for recaptured fish as the transition size $L_f = 9.32 \text{cm}$.

% We used the average size of the first female observation for recaptured fish as the estimate $L_f$, 
% For fish caught as both male and female, we used the size recorded when they were first captured as female (full data set shown in Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}d). We used the mean of those sizes as our estimate of $L_f$ and randomly sampled from the full set with replacement to generate a distribution of sizes to use in our uncertainty calculations. 

\subsection{Fecundity} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_Fecundity}

We used a size-dependent fecundity relationship determined using photos of egg clutches and females from field sampling, where the number of eggs per clutch ($E_c$) is exponentially related to the length in cm of the female ($L$) with size effect $\beta_l = 2.388$, intercept $b = 1.174$, and egg age effect $\beta_e = -0.608$ dependent on if the eggs were old enough to have visible eyes. For fish larger or equal to the transition to female size $L_f$, we multiplied the number of eyed eggs per clutch by the number of clutches per year $c_e = 11.9$ \citep[estimate from][]{holtswarth2017fecundity} to get total annual fecundity $f$ for a female of length $L$:

\begin{equation}
f(L) = 
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{if } L < L_f \\
c_e * e^{\beta_l\ln(L) + \beta_e[\text{eyed}] + b}, & L \geq L_f. \label{EQN_Fec}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

We did not consider uncertainty in fecundity but did consider uncertainty in the transition size to breeding female (Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}).
% \begin{equation}
% f = c_e * e^{\beta_l\ln(L) + \beta_e[\text{eyed}] + b}. \label{EQN_Fec}
% \end{equation}

\subsection{Lifetime egg production (LEP)} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_LEP}

To compute LEP, we discretized time and size (in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}), using 100 time steps and 100 equal size bins, and summed across the matrix. When entering the starting individual into the matrix, we used 0.1 as the standard deviation of size to spread out the starting individual across size bins. The size disribution at each time ($v_{L,t}$) represents the probability that the individual has survived and grown into each of the possible size categories. To account for differences in growth rates across fish, we used the size determined by the growth curve (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}) as the mean along with an estimate of spread ($\text{size}_{sd}$) when projecting the size distribution of the fish in the next year. To estimate $\text{size}_{sd}$, we selected fish within 0.1 cm of the mean size at the first capture point for fish recaptured a year later (7.4--7.6 cm). We used the standard deviation of the sizes of those fish when they were recaptured one year later as $\text{size}_{sd}$ (=1.45) (Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}). % Which size was that? Put the numbers of starting size and spread in here?

LEP was estimated by patch ($\text{LEP}_i$) because each patch has a different estimate of adult survival. We also present the average LEP across patches, noted as $\text{LEP}_*$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}b) and used to estimate average LRP and LR for the metapopulation (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}c, d). 

To estimate egg-recruit survival ($S_e$), we used the expected lifetime egg production for a fish that has already survived to reach parent size (6.0 cm) so $L_s$ in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP} = 6.0, rather than 3.5. We used the average LEP for parent-sized fish across patches, noted as LEPp.

% To compute LEP, we discretize time and size and sum across the matrix. When entering the starting individual into the matrix, we use 0.1 as the standard deviation of size to spread the starting individual across size bins ($\text{size}_{\text{recruit}, sd}$). When projecting the distribution of the size of the fish in the next year, we used the growth curve (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}) to find the mean and an estimate from our recapture data of the standard deviation ($\text{size}_{sd}$) of the distribution of sizes in the next year of fish starting from one size (\ref{APP_TAB_Params}). % EDIT THIS TO MAKE MORE SENSE! MAYBE WILL's COMMENTS WILL HELP?

%We only considered reproductive effort once the fish is female and used the average size of first female observation for recaptured fish as the transition size $L_f = 9.32 \text{cm}$.

\subsection{Accounting for density dependence} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_DD}

In 2015 and 2017, we did a more thorough survey of anemones at sampled patches and noted anemones occupied by yellowtail anemonefish, occupied by other species of anemonefish, and unoccupied by anemonefish. We found the proportion of anemones occupied by yellowtail anemonefish ($p_A$) and the proportion of anemones unoccupied by any anemonefish ($p_U$) for all patches combined and averaged across the two sample years. We used these average proportions to estimate the proportional increase (D) in unoccupied anemones if all anemones occupied by yellowtail anemonefish were unoccupied as described in the main text. We did not consider uncertainty in the effect of density dependence.

\subsection{Alternative geographies and larval navigation} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_Larval_nav}

\paragraph*{Larval navigation} %\label{APP_SEC_METHODS_Larval_nav}

In our sensitivity test for larval navigation and swimming abilities, we added a buffer ranging from 0--1 km to the edges of the destination patches when determining probability of dispersal between patches. To avoid overlapping shadows of effective area of neighboring patches, we added no more than half the distance between two adjacent patches to each patch. The buffers also changed the proportion of the sampling region that was habitat ($P_h$, see Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_ScalingUpRecruits}), as we considered the buffer areas to be habitat as well, and affected the scaling of recruits (Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_ScalingUpRecruits}) in egg-recruit survival (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}).

\subsection{Scaling up recruits} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_ScalingUpRecruits}

To estimate the total number of offspring produced by genotyped parents that survived to recruitment, we scaled up the number of matched offspring caught during sampling ($R_m$) to account for recruits our sampling could have missed (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_RecruitScalingSchematic}). We scaled up by 1) the cumulative proportion of habitat we sampled at our patches over time ($P_h$) to account for recruits at anemones we did not sample, 2) the probability of capturing a fish if we sampled its anemone ($P_c$) to account for fish that escaped during sampling, 3) the proportion of the dispersal kernel from our patches covered within our sampling region ($P_d$) to account for fish that dispersed outside of our sampling area (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_PropDispKernelAreaSampled}), and 4) the proportion of our sampling region that was habitat ($P_s$) to avoid counting mortality of fish dispersing to non-habitat within our region twice. The latter term is important because mortality from dispersing to non-habitat is both in the estimate of total recruits (numerator of eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}) and in the integrated dispersal kernel (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_integratingDK}). %, and 5) the proportion of anemones occupied by \textit{A. clarkii} ($DD$) to account for density-dependent mortality of settling recruits.

\paragraph*{Proportion of habitat sampled ($P_h$)} % \label{APP_SEC_ProbHabSampled}

We used tagged anemones to estimate the proportion of habitat we sampled within our patches (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_PercHabSampled}). We tagged each anemone that was home to yellowtail anemonefish with a metal tag, which is relatively permanent and easy to re-sight (the anemone tag is visible above the anemone in Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Map_and_photo}c). We therefore considered the total number of metal-tagged anemones at a patch to be the habitat present. We used proportion of anemones rather than proportion of total patch area because anemones, and therefore habitat quality, were unevenly distributed across each patch; areas we did not visit typically had a lower anemone density than the areas we did sample. % We divided the number of tagged anemones visited each sampling year by the total number of metal tags at that patch to get the proportion of habitat sampled. We used tagged anemones to estimate the proportion of habitat we sampled at each patch in each year ($P_{h_{i,t}}$).

To scale the number of sampled offspring from genotyped parents ($R_m$) to account for areas of our patches we did not sample, we used the overall proportion habitat sampled across all patches and sampling years ($P_h$). We summed the number of metal-tagged anemones we visited across all patches and years, then divided by the number of anemones we could have sampled (the sum of total metal-tagged anemones across all patches multiplied by the number of sampling years). We did not consider uncertainty in the proportion of habitat sampled.

\paragraph*{Probability of capturing a fish, from recapture dives ($P_c$)} %\label{APP_SEC_ProbR}

We used the probability of capturing a fish to scale up the number of sampled offspring from genotyped parents ($R_m$) to account for recruits we missed by failing to capture them. To estimate the probability of capturing a fish given that we sampled its anemone ($P_c$), we used mark-recapture data from recapture dives done within a sampling season. During some of the sampling years, we intentionally re-sampled some locations within a few weeks of the original sampling dives. We assumed that the probability of recapturing a fish on a recapture dive was the same as capturing a fish on a sampling dive, essentially that there was no mortality in the weeks between dives and that the fish did not alter their behavior towards divers. For each recapture dive, we used GPS tracks of the divers to identify the anemones covered in the recapture dive and the set of PIT-tagged fish encountered on those anemones during the original sampling dives. We estimated the probability of capture $P_c$ as the number of tagged fish re-caught during the capture dive $m_2$ divided by the total number of fish caught on the recapture dive $n_2$: $P_c = \frac{m_2}{n_2}$. %The value of $P_c$ from each recapture dive is reported in Table \ref{APP_TAB_RecapDives}. CHECK THIS AND REWORD!!!

We used the mean $P_c$ across all 14 recapture dives, covering 10 patches over three sampling seasons (2016, 2017, 2018), as our best estimate. Uncertainty details are in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}.

% To consider uncertainty in $P_c$, we represented the probability of capture as a beta distribution, using the mean $\mu_{P_c}$ and variance $V_{P_c}$ of the set of 14 values to find the appropriate $\alpha_{P_c}$ and $\beta_{P_c}$ parameters, where 

% \begin{eqnarray}
% \alpha_{P_c} &=& (\frac{1-\mu_{P_c}}{V_{P_c}} - \frac{1}{\mu_{P_c}}) \mu_{P_c}^2 \\
% \beta_{P_c} &=& \alpha_{\mu_{P_c}} \times \frac{1}{\mu_{P_c} - 1}. \label{APP_EQN_ProbCapBetaDistParams}  % Should I cite a source for this?
% \end{eqnarray}

% % Should I include a table of the recapture probs for each recapture dive, including site and year?
% The mean of the individual capture probability values was $\mu_{P_c} = 0.56$, with variance $V_{P_c} = 0.069$, giving beta distribution parameters $\alpha_{P_c} = 1.44$ and $\beta_{P_c} = 1.13$. We sampled 1000 values from the beta distribution, then truncated the sample to include only values larger than the lowest value of $P_c$ estimated from an individual dive (0.20), to avoid unrealistically low values randomly sampled from the distribution. We then sampled with replacement from the truncated set to get a vector of 1000 values.

\paragraph*{Proportion of dispersal kernel area sampled ($P_d$)} %\label{APP_SEC_PropDispKernelSampled}

To account for recruits that dispersed outside our sampling region, we found the proportion of the dispersal kernels from all parents that fell within our sampling region (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_PropDispKernelAreaSampled}). For each patch \textit{i}, we found the area under the kernel ($A_i$) from the center of the patch to the north edge of the sampling area ($d_{N,i}$) (northern-most tagged anemone at Palanas, the northern-most patch) and from the center of the patch to the south edge of the sampling area ($d_{S,i}$) (southern-most tagged anemone at Sitio Baybayon, the southern-most patch), then multiplied by the number of genotyped parents at that patch ($N_{g_i}$):

\begin{equation} 
%p_{A, B}(d) = \int_{d_1}^{d_2} e^k e^{-(e^k d)^\theta}  dd. \label{EQN_integratingDK}
A_i = N_{g_i} \frac{e^{K_d}\theta}{2\Gamma({\frac{1}{\theta})}} \left( \int_{0}^{d_N}e^{-(e^{K_d}d)^\theta}  dd + \int_{0}^{d_S}e^{-(e^{K_d}d)^\theta}  dd \right). 
\end{equation}

We added the areas together, then divided by the total number of genotyped parents ($N_g$) to get the proportion of the total dispersal kernel area covered by our sampling region ($P_d$):

\begin{equation}
P_d = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{19} A_i}{N_g}. \label{EQN_DK_area_within_sampling_region}
\end{equation}

We did not consider uncertainty in $P_d$.

\paragraph*{Proportion habitat in sampling area ($P_s$)} %\label{APP_SEC_PropHabInSampledRegion}

To avoid implicitly counting mortality due to larvae settling on non-habitat twice --- once in scaling up our matched recruits (who settled on habitat) and once in integrating the dispersal kernel --- we scaled the estimate of total recruits produced by parents on our patches by the proportion of our sampling region that was habitat ($P_s$). We found $P_s$ by summing the lengths of all the patches, which run approximately north-south, and dividing by the total north-south distance of our sampling region, giving $P_s = 0.20$. We assumed that larvae were unable to navigate to habitat if they dispersed to an unsuitable area but relaxed that assumption in our sensitivity tests (Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Larval_nav}) because anemonefish larvae do likely have some ability both to sense good settlement areas by detecting host anemones \citep{elliott1995host, arvedlund1999host} or conspecifics \citep[e.g.,][for coral reef fish more broadly]{lecchini2005experimental}, and to swim in a particular direction \citep[e.g.,][]{bellwood2001relative, fisher2005swimming}. 

\subsection{Characterizing uncertainty} \label{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}

\paragraph*{Dispersal kernel} %\label{APP_SEC_Uncertainty_Dispersal}

To account for uncertainty in the dispersal kernel, we used sets of the shape parameter $\theta$ and the scale parameter $K_d$ that represented the span of the 95\% confidence interval when $K_d$ and $\theta$ were estimated jointly \citep[Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}a,][]{catalanoInPrepconnectivity}. We randomly sampled pairs of $\theta$ and $K_d$ parameters from the distribution, weighted by the log-likelihood.

\paragraph*{Growth} %\label{APP_SEC_Uncertainty_Growth}

We used the first and second capture lengths for fish that were recaught after a year (within 345 to 385 days) to estimate $L_\infty$ and $k$ (using eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}). For fish recaptured more than once, we randomly selected only one recapture period from each to use to estimate the von Bertalanffy parameters and repeated the random selection and estimate 1000 times. We found the mean estimates ($L_\infty$ = 10.70 cm, $k$ = 0.864) and mean standard error of those fits, then sampled from within that range to generate a set of von Bertalanffy growth curves to use in our LEP calculations (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}b, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}).

\paragraph*{Survival ($\phi$)} %\label{APP_SEC_Uncertainty_Survival}

We incorporated uncertainty in adult survival by sampling from within the 95\% confidence limits for the patch-based survival estimates and size effect on survival as estimated by the lowest AICc model from MARK (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_SiteSurvivals}, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SurvBySizeAndSite}). For the simulations for the alternative geographies and larval navigation, we used the survival estimate and 95\% range for the patch with median survival (Elementary School).

\paragraph*{Size of transition to female ($L_f$)} %\label{APP_SEC_Uncertainty_FemaleSize}

To incorporate uncertainty in the size at which male fish transition to female ($L_f$), we sampled with replacement directly from the sizes at which recaptured fish were first captured as female (5.2 cm--12.7 cm) (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}d). Reproductive output is only counted once fish reach the female stage, so $L_f$ affects fecundity (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{EQN_Fec}) and therefore the fecundity kernel in calculating lifetime egg production ($f_L$ in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}).

\paragraph*{Recruit size ($\text{size}_\text{recruit}$)} %\label{APP_SEC_Uncertainty_RecruitSize}

We incorporated uncertainty in the size of a recruit ($\text{size}_\text{recruit}$) by sampling from a uniform distribution across the ranges of possible sizes of recruits for the parentage analysis (3.5--6.0 cm) (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}a). Recruit size enters into LEP as the starting size of the individual fish in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}.

\paragraph*{Probability of capturing a fish ($P_c$)} %\label{APP_SEC_Uncertainty_Pc}

To consider uncertainty in the probability of capturing a fish given that we sampled its anemone ($P_c$), we represented the probability of capture as a beta distribution, using the mean $\mu_{P_c}$ and variance $V_{P_c}$ of the set of 14 values calculated from individual recapture dives to find the appropriate $\alpha_{P_c}$ and $\beta_{P_c}$ parameters, where 

\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha_{P_c} &=& (\frac{1-\mu_{P_c}}{V_{P_c}} - \frac{1}{\mu_{P_c}}) \mu_{P_c}^2 \\
\beta_{P_c} &=& \alpha_{\mu_{P_c}} \times \frac{1}{\mu_{P_c} - 1}. \label{APP_EQN_ProbCapBetaDistParams}  % Should I cite a source for this?
\end{eqnarray}

% Should I include a table of the recapture probs for each recapture dive, including site and year?
The mean of the individual capture probability values was $\mu_{P_c} = 0.56$, with variance $V_{P_c} = 0.069$, giving beta distribution parameters $\alpha_{P_c} = 1.44$ and $\beta_{P_c} = 1.13$. We sampled 1000 values from the beta distribution, then truncated the sample to include only values larger or equal to the lowest value of $P_c$ estimated from an individual dive (0.20), to avoid unrealistically low values randomly sampled from the distribution. We then sampled with replacement from the truncated set to get a vector of 1000 values (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}c). $P_c$ is one of the scaling factors in the estimate of egg-recruit survival (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}), accounting for recruits we missed by failing to capture them.

\paragraph*{Lifetime Egg Production (LEP)} %\label{APP_SEC_Uncertainty_LEP}

Uncertainty in lifetime egg production enters through adult survival, growth, and the size of a recruit (Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}), all of which affect the size distribution across time $v_{L,t}$ in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}. Additionally, uncertainty in the size of transition to female ($L_f$, Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}) affects the fecundity kernel $f_L$ in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}. We show the contribution of uncertainty of each input in Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP}.

\paragraph*{Egg-recruit survival ($S_e$)} %\label{APP_SEC_Uncertainty_Egg-recruit-surv}

In estimating egg-recruit survival ($S_e$), we considered uncertainty in the number of offspring assigned to parents ($R_m$) and in the probability of capturing a fish ($P_c$). For offspring assigned to parents, we generated a set of values for the number of assigned offspring using a random binomial, with the number of genotyped offspring (791) as the number of trials and the assignment rate from the parentage analysis (0.090) as the probability of success on each trial \citep{catalanoInPrepconnectivity} (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}d). Uncertainty in probability of capture $P_c$ is described in SI \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}. We show the contribution of uncertainty of each input in Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_RperE}.

% For the probability of capturing a fish given that we sampled its anemone ($P_c$), we sampled values from a beta distribution that captured the mean and variance of capture probabilities across recapture dives. We represented the probability of capture as a beta distribution, using the mean $\mu_{P_c}$ and variance $V_{P_c}$ of the set of 14 values to find the appropriate $\alpha_{P_c}$ and $\beta_{P_c}$ parameters, where

% The mean of the individual capture probability values was $\mu_{P_c} = 0.56$, with variance $V_{P_c} = 0.069$, giving beta distribution parameters $\alpha_{P_c} = 1.44$ and $\beta_{P_c} = 1.13$. We sampled 1000 values from the beta distribution, then truncated the sample to include only values larger than the lowest value of $P_c$ estimated from an individual dive (0.20), to avoid unrealistically low values randomly sampled from the distribution. We then sampled with replacement from the truncated set to get a vector of 1000 values. %$P_c$ is one of the scaling factors in the estimate of egg-recruit survival (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}), accounting for recruits we missed by failing to capture them.

\section{Supplemental Results} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS} %%% STILL NEED TO REARRANGE ORDER TO MATCH MAIN TEXT! 

\subsection{Parentage} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Parentage}

From the genetic work and parentage analysis done in \cite{catalanoInPrepconnectivity}, we genotyped 1729 potential parents, genotyped 791 potential offspring (recruits), and matched 71 offspring to parents, with an assignment rate of 9\%. In estimates with uncertainty, the middle 95\% distribution of matched offspring was 55 to 87 (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}d, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}).

The combined number of potential parents and potential offspring is higher than the number of genotyped fish because some fish are included as both a potential offspring and a potential parent (in different years).

\subsection{Dispersal kernel} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Dispersal}

We used the dispersal kernel estimated for all years together in \cite{catalanoInPrepconnectivity} (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_integratingDK}), with $K_d = -2.51$ and $\theta = 1.49$. Using the 95\% confidence surface when $K_d$ and $\theta$ were estimated jointly to incoporate uncertainty (Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}), $K_d$ ranged from -2.86 to -1.82 and $\theta$ from 0.87 to 2.46 (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}a, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}).

\subsection{Growth} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Growth}

From the mark-recapture analysis of tagged and genotyped fish, we estimated mean values of $L_\infty = 10.70$ cm with uncertainty bounds 9.81--11.65 and $k = 0.864$ with uncertainty bounds 0.80--0.91 for the von Bertalanffy growth curve parameters (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}). 

\subsection{Survival} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Survival}

The best model for post-recruitment annual survival $\phi$ on a log-odds scale had a positive size effect ($b_a = 0.15 \pm 0.029$ SE) with intercepts $b_{\phi_i}$ varying by patch (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{APP_EQN_Survival}, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SurvBySizeAndSite}, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_SiteSurvivals}):

\begin{equation}
\log(\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}) = b_{\phi_i} + b_a\text{size}. \label{APP_EQN_Survival}
\end{equation}

The accompanying best model for recapture probability $p_r$ on a log-odds scale had a negative effect of size ($b_1 = -0.16 \pm 0.09$ SE) and a negative effect of diver distance from anemone ($b_2 = -0.15 \pm 0.02$ SE), with intercept $b_{p_r} = 2.14 \pm 0.87$ SE (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{APP_EQN_MARK_Recapture}, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_RecapSizeDistEffect}):

\begin{equation}
\log(\frac{p_r}{1-p_r}) = b_{p_r} + b_1\text{size} + b_2d. \label{APP_EQN_MARK_Recapture}
\end{equation}

This suggests divers were less likely to recapture larger fish, who are stronger swimmers and more likely to flee when divers approach, and those at anemones far from areas sampled.

\subsection{Scaling factors} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_ScalingFactors}

The proportion of habitat at patches sampled over time ($P_h$) was 0.41, the proportion of the region that was habitat ($P_s$) was 0.20, the proportion of the dispersal kernel that was within the sampling region ($P_d$) was 0.57, and the probability of capturing a fish given that its anemone was sampled ($P_c$) was 0.56 [0.22, 0.97] (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}c, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}).

\subsection{Lifetime egg production (LEP)} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_LEP}  % IS THIS SECTION NECESSARY OR IS THIS IN MAIN RESULTS?
% For our persistence metrics, we present the estimate using the demographic and connectivity input values without uncertainty (the mean of the uncertainty distributions, with the exception of the size range for recruit), as the best estimate and the range with uncertainty shown in brackets. Using our best estimates for growth, survival, and fecundity, w
We calculated an average value of LEP across patches ($\text{LEP}_*$) of 827 [227, 2919] eggs (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}b), with best estimate values at individual patches that ranged from 0 to 1760 eggs (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_PatchSpecificLEPandLRP}). Uncertainty in adult survival had the largest effect on LEP (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP}), which corresponds to longer-surviving individuals having more opportunities to reproduce at larger sizes. 

\subsection{Egg-recruit survival ($S_e$)} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Egg-recruit_survival}  % IS THIS SECTION NECESSARY OR IS THIS IN MAIN RESULTS?

We estimated egg-recruit survival $S_{e}$ to be 0.002 [5 x $10^{-4}$, 0.01] when we accounted for density dependence in our data. Uncertainty in the size of transition to breeding female $L_f$ had the largest effect on egg-recruit survival (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_RperE}); the larger the transition size to female, the fewer tagged eggs we estimated were produced by our genotyped parents and the higher the estimate of egg-recruit survival. This differs from our finding above that adult survival had the largest effect on LEP because the starting size of the individual considered is lower when we estimate LEP for a recruit (4.4 cm, 3.5-6.0cm range) than for a parent (6.0cm). Fish considered parents in our parentage analysis have already survived one or more years since recruiting so the transition to breeding female plays a larger role in the number of eggs they are likely to produce than for fish who have just recruited. 

% \subsection{Abundance trends by patch}

% We used the number of females captured at each patch in each sampling year, scaled by the proportion of habitat sampled at that patch in that year and by the probability of capturing a fish, to estimate abundance trends for each patch (Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_AbundanceBySite}). Seventeen of the patches showed positive abundance trends (Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_AbundanceBySite}a-q), while the two southern-most patches showed declines (Haina and Sitio Baybayon, Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_AbundanceBySite}r,s).

\subsection{Persistence metrics without compensation for density dependence} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_noDD} %NEED TO REPLACE THESE METRICS WITH THE UPDATED VALUES!!!
Estimating persistence metrics without compensating for density dependence in our data (subscript D) gave us an understanding of whether individuals at our patches were able to replace themselves and whether our patches would persist in isolation at the current abundance levels, rather than at low abundance. Without compensation for early life density dependence, all of our metrics showed that the set of patches we sampled was less likely to persist as an isolated network than the metrics for low abundance. We estimated egg-recruit survival ($S_{e_{D}}$) to be 0.001 [3 x $10^{-4}$, 0.004] and average lifetime recruit production across patches ($\text{LRP}_{D}$) to be 0.96 [0.51, 3.08], with 52\% of $\text{LRP}_{D}$ estimates $\geq 1$ (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_LRP_LocalReplacement_noDD}a). Our estimate of local replacement ($\text{LR}_{D}$), which estimates replacement for recruits from our patches returning to our patches implictly including dispersal, was 0.11 [0.06, 0.35] (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_LRP_LocalReplacement_noDD}b). 

When we calculated LR using all arriving recruits to our patches, however, rather than just those originating there, the best estimate was $> 1$ (1.22), suggesting that there was recruit-recruit replacement at our patches when we included immigrant recruits, even at current population levels when density dependence was present.

We did not find any patches with a best estimate of $\text{SP}_{D} \geq 1$ or with uncertainty bounds that reached or exceeded 1 (Appendix Figs.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat_noDD}a). Our best estimate of the dominant eigenvalue of the realized connectivity matrix $\lambda_{c_{D}}$ was 0.11 [0.06, 0.47] with 0\% of estimates where $\lambda_{c_{D}} \geq 1$ (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat_noDD}c).

%% MOVE TO SUPPLEMENT! Malin comment: to supplement, perhaps in a section comparing to other studies, Will thinks okay to delete entirely but also okay in SI
% Our equation for SP is a modification of that used in \cite{burgess2014beyond}, which uses LEP to represent offspring produced and uses local retention (the number of surviving recruits that disperse back to the natal patch divided by the number of eggs produced by the natal patch) to capture egg-recruit survival and dispersal combined: $\text{LEP} \times \text{local retention} \geq 1$. We modify this to include egg-recruit survival in the offspring term instead, using LRP in place of LEP. %, to assess whether a particular patch $i$ is self-persistent.

% \paragraph{Recapture model} 
% The best model for log-odds recapture probability, accompanying the survival model in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_Survival}, has a size effect ($b_1 = -1.816 \pm 0.080$ SE, Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_RecapSizeDistEffect}a) and a negative effect of diver distance from the anemone ($b_2 = -0.171 \pm 0.021$ SE, Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_RecapSizeDistEffect}b), with intercept $b_{p_r} = 17.93 \pm 0.858$ SE:

% \begin{equation}
% \log(\frac{p_r}{1-p_r}) = b_{p_r} + b_1\text{size} + b_2d. \label{APP_EQN_MARK_Recapture}
% \end{equation}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \log(\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}) &=& b_\phi + b_a\text{size} \\
% \log(\frac{p_r}{1-p_r}) &=& b_{p_r} + b_1\text{size} + b_2d. \label{EQN_Survival}
% \end{eqnarray}
%These results suggest that larger fish have higher annual survival, which is similar to survival estimates in other clownfish species (check Buston paper). 

% The negative effect of both size and distance suggest that divers are less likely to recapture larger fish and those at anemones far from areas sampled. %, with the chance of recapturing an average-sized fish falling below 5\% if a diver stays farther than XX from its home anemone.

% Add plot of distances to anems in different years?
% Add plot of effect of size and distance on recapture probability?

% From the mark-recapture analysis of tagged and genotyped fish, we estimate mean values of $L_\infty = 10.71 \text{cm}$ (range of estimates 10.50 - 10.90 cm) and $K = 0.864$ (range of estimates 0.785 - 0.944) for the von Bertalanffy growth curve parameters (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}). For juvenile and adult (post-recruitment) survival on a log-odds scale, the best-fit model has an effect of size, with coefficient $b_a = 0.169 \pm 0.028$ SE and intercept $b_\phi = -1.83 \pm 0.231$ SE (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_Survival}). The accompanying best-fit model for log-odds recapture probability has a negative size effect and a negative effect of diver distance from the anemone (eqn.\ \ref{APP_EQN_MARKRecapture}, Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_RecapSizeDistEffect}).

% 	\caption{Relationships among parameters and metrics. a) We only count reproductive effort by fish in the female stage so the higher the transition size to breeding female, the fewer eggs parents are considered to produce, which increases the estiamted egg-recruit survival. b) LRP strongly affects NP by changing the number of potential recruits dispered through the connectivity matrix. c) The probability of capturing a fish does not have a clear relationship to NP. d) LEP is higher with higher survival estimates because fish are more likely to survive longer as reproducing adults. e) The size we consider to be a recruit marks the transition of mortality included in egg-recruit survival to mortality being captured by annual adult survival. Because we do not have the data to change egg-recruit survival to account for different recruit sizes, increasing the recruit size increases LRP by wrapping more mortality into the egg-recruit survival estimate, rather than LEP. \label{APP_FIG_ParamMetricRelationships}}

% \subsection{Effects of different types of uncertainty on metrics}

% Here we show the contribution of uncertainty in each input to the overall uncertainty in the values of LEP (Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP}), $\text{LRP}_{DD}$ (Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP_R}), egg-recruit survival $S_{e_{DD}}$ (Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_RperE}), and network persistence $\lambda_{c_{DD}}$ (Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_NP}). We calculate the metrics using best estimates for all inputs except the one shown and show the results as violin plots, which show vertical probability densities of the metrics across a range of values.
