\section*{Abstract}
Determining metapopulation persistence requires an understanding of both demographic rates and connectivity among patches. Persistence is well understood in theory but has proved challenging to test empirically for marine and other species with high connectivity that precludes classic colonization/extinction dynamics. Here, we assessed persistence for a metapopulation of yellowtail anemonefish (\textit{Amphiprion clarkii}) using seven years of annual sampling data along 30 km of coastline. We also carefully accounted for uncertainty in demographic rates. Despite stable population sizes through time and sufficient production of surviving offspring for replacement, the spatial pattern of connectivity made the metapopulation unlikely to persist in isolation. To persist, the metapopulation would need higher fecundity or to retain essentially all of the recruits it produced. This assessment of persistence in a marine metapopulation shows that stable abundance alone does not indicate persistence, emphasizing the necessity of assessing both demographic and connectivity processes to understand metapopulation dynamics.

\section*{Introduction} 

The dynamics and persistence of metapopulations depend both on connectivity among patches and on demographic rates within each patch \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, hanski1998metapopulation}. For marine species, connectivity among habitat patches primarily occurs during planktonic larval stages when individuals are hard to track and are able to travel long distances with ocean currents. Because larval connectivity has been perceived to be the greatest uncertainty in these systems, research has centered on quantifying that component \citep[reviewed by][]{white2019connectivity}. More recently, it has become apparent that variation in demographic rates among patches is also an uncertain aspect of marine metapopulation dynamics \citep{hameed2016inverse, white2011oceanographic}. Given both of those uncertainties and driven by both fundamental ecological questions and applied needs \citep{botsford_dependence_2001,white_population_2010}, a large body of theory has developed to describe how connectivity and local demography interact to determine whether marine metapopulations persist \citep{burgess2014beyond, botsford2019population}. Testing this theory, however, has proven substantially more difficult.

For any population to persist, individuals must on average replace themselves during their lifetime. Assessing replacement must account for demographic processes across the life cycle, including how likely individuals are to survive to the next age or stage, their expected fecundity at each stage, the survival to recruitment of any offspring produced, and the distribution of offspring across space \citep{hastings_persistence_2006}. A metapopulation can persist via two mechanisms: 1) at least one patch achieves replacement in isolation (self-persistence), or 2) multiple patches receive enough recruitment to achieve replacement through multi-generational loops of connectivity with other patches in the metapopulation (network persistence) \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, burgess2014beyond}. Theory predicts that habitat patches that are large relative to the mean dispersal distance are likely to be self-persistent \citep{white_population_2010}. 

New ways of identifying individuals and determining their origins now allow better measurements of connectivity in marine populations \citep{almany2017larval, daloia_self-recruitment_2013}. Additionally, a better appreciation of the relevant theory has led to measurement of the demographic factors necessary to assess persistence in field metapopulations \citep{carson2011evaluating, hameed2016inverse, johnson2018integrating, salles_coral_2015}. To date, research has suggested that populations on isolated islands can be self-persistent, which might be expected given that they lack nearby populations from which to receive larvae \citep{salles_coral_2015}. In contrast, small habitat patches spread across a larger reef metapopulation appear to rely on input from surrounding and intervening patches for persistence \citep{johnson2018integrating}. Isolated habitat patches are rare in the marine environment and clarifying whether intervening habitat patches are sufficient to allow metapopulations to achieve replacement is a key question. Persistence has yet to be quantified in the field for a continuous marine metapopulation. 

Here, we further our understanding of metapopulation dynamics in a network of patches along a continuous coastline through a study of yellowtail anemonefish (\textit{Amphiprion clarkii}) in the Philippines. We assessed persistence for all patches of habitat within a metapopulation spread across 30 km of coastline. Based on seven years of data, we found that, despite containing multiple patches with large abundances that were stable over time, the metapopulation was not likely to be persistent without immigration from outside patches.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Persistence theory and metrics}

We considered four primary metrics to assess whether and how the anemonefish metapopulation was persistent: 1) lifetime recruit production (LRP) to assess whether the metapopulation had enough offspring that survived anywhere to achieve replacement, 2) self-persistence (SP) to assess whether any individual patch could persist in isolation without input from other patches, 3) network persistence ($\lambda_c$) to assess whether the metapopulation was persistent as a connected unit, and 4) local replacement (LR) to assess whether a sufficient number of recruits were retained anywhere within the metapopulation to achieve replacement, without explicitly estimating dispersal patterns (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Metric_life_cycle_schematics}a-d). We explain each metric below in detail. To represent the uncertainty in our estimates, we calculated each metric 1000 times, sampling each input parameter from a distribution representing the uncertainty in the empirical estimate (details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty} in Supporting Information). In our results, we show point estimates of each metric along with uncertainty bounds, defined as the middle 95\% of the distribution of values calculated in this Monte Carlo procedure. We provide additional method details, results, tables and figures in the appendix (methods: Appendix \ref{APP_SUPP_METHODS}, results: Appendix \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS}, tables: Appendix \ref{APP_SEC_TABLES}, figures: Appendix \ref{APP_SEC_FIGURES}).% Should this have the \% Reference the section with \ref?

\paragraph*{Lifetime recruit production (LRP)}
$\text{LRP}_i$ is the expected number of recruits a recruit on patch $i$ will produce in its lifetime,

\begin{equation}
\text{LRP}_i = \text{LEP}_i \times S_e, \label{EQN_LRP}
\end{equation}

where $\text{LEP}_i$ (lifetime egg production) is the patch-specific number of eggs a recruit produces in its lifetime and $S_e$ (egg-recruit survival) is the fraction of eggs that survive to become recruits (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Schematic}).

If $\text{LRP} \geq 1$, individuals produced enough surviving offspring, before considering dispersal, to potentially achieve replacement. If $\text{LRP} < 1$, the population could not persist without input from outside patches. We considered all recruits produced by adults in our metapopulation to estimate $\text{LRP}_i$, regardless of where they settled. 

\paragraph*{Self-persistence (SP)} 

$\text{SP}_i$ is the number of offspring a recruit produces that survive to become recruits and settle in the natal patch,

\begin{equation}
\text{SP}_i = \text{LRP}_i \times p_{i,i}, \label{EQN_SP} 
\end{equation}

where $p_{i,i}$ is the probability of larval retention on patch $i$.

A patch $i$ is self-persistent if $\text{SP}_i \geq 1$. If at least one patch is self-persistent, the metapopulation as a whole persists as well \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, burgess2014beyond}. 

\paragraph*{Network persistence ($\lambda_c$)}

Network persistence is the largest real eigenvalue $\lambda_C$ of the realized connectivity matrix $C$,

\begin{equation}
C_{i,j} = \text{LRP}_i \times p_{i,j}, \label{EQN_Connectivity_matrix}
\end{equation} 

created by multiplying lifetime recruit production ($\text{LRP}_i$) by dispersal probabilities among pairs of patches ($p_{i,j}$) \citep{burgess2014beyond}. The diagonal entries of $C$ are the self-persistence values for each patch ($\text{SP}_i$).

Network persistence explicitly considers dispersal of individuals among patches in addition to the reproduction and survival at each patch and requires $\lambda_C \geq 1$ for the network to persist without outside input \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, white_population_2010, burgess2014beyond}.

\paragraph*{Local replacement (LR)}

Local replacement (LR) is the number of recruits a recruit produces in its lifetime that return to settle within the focal metapopulation. LR is related to LRP, but in contrast, LRP also includes recruits that settle outside of the focal metapopulation. LR is defined as 

\begin{equation}
\text{LR} = \text{LEP}_* \times R_e, \label{EQN_LR}
\end{equation}

where $\text{LEP}_*$ is lifetime egg production averaged across patches and $R_e$ is the proportion of eggs that survived and returned to recruit at the patches in our focal metapopulation (the 30 km section of coastline). $R_e$ is a modification of egg-recruit survival ($S_e$) that implicitly considers dispersal in terms of larvae landing inside or outside the metapopulation. 

If $\text{LR} \geq 1$, enough offspring were locally retained to achieve replacement if they were evenly spread among patches, but the actual dispersal patterns among the metapopulation patches may still prevent replacement if the pattern of multigenerational replacement does not satisfy network persistence ($\lambda_c$). LR and $\lambda_c$ both assess the ability of our patches to persist as an isolated group, but LR treats the network as one large homogenous patch while $\lambda_c$ explicitly accounts for the structure and connectivity among patches.  

\subsection*{Study species}

We focused on a tropical metapopulation of yellowtail anemonefish (\textit{Amphiprion clarkii}, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Map_and_photo}c). Yellowtail anemonefish have a mutualistic relationship with anemones that house small colonies of fish \citep{buston2003social, fautin1992field}. Yellowtail anemonefish are protandrous hermaphrodites and maintain a size-structured hierarchy; within an anemone, the largest fish is the breeding female, the next largest is the breeding male, and any smaller fish are non-breeding juveniles. The fish move up in rank to become breeders only after the larger fish have died. In the tropical patch reef habitat of the Philippines, yellowtail anemonefish primarily spawn from November to May and lay clutches of benthic eggs that the parents protect and tend \citep{ochi1989mating, holtswarth2017fecundity}. Larvae hatch after about six days and spend 7--10 days in the water column before returning to reef habitat to settle in an anemone \citep{fautin1992field}.

Anemonefish are well-suited to metapopulation studies because dispersal only occurs during the larval phase and adults have limited movement on discrete habitat patches (anemones) \citep[e.g.,][]{buston2013marine, salles_coral_2015, almany2017larval}. Yellowtail anemonefish tend to behave more like other reef fishes, with wider-ranging territories and stronger swimming abilities \citep{hattori1991life, ochi1989mating} than the smaller \textit{A. percula} commonly used in metapopulation studies \citep[e.g.,][]{buston2011probability, salles_coral_2015}. 

\paragraph*{Field data collection}

We focused on a set of nineteen reef patches spanning 30 km along the western coast of Leyte island facing the Camotes Sea in the Philippines (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Map_and_photo}a). The habitat patches covered approximately 20\% of the sampling region and consisted of rocky patches of coral reef separated by sand flats (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Map_and_photo}a,b). To the north, the patches were isolated from nearby habitat with no substantial reef habitat for at least 20 km, a distance greater than the mean dispersal distance for this species \citep{pinsky2010using}. As such, we considered this to be a relatively isolated metapopulation. Located near a populated coastline, the region experiences anthropogenic effects including fishing, pollution, and runoff from agriculture and a nearby riverbed gravel mine, as well as reef-destroying storms like Haiyan and other typhoons in 2013.

From 2012-2018, we sampled fish and habitat at most patches each year (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_PercHabSampled}). Divers using SCUBA and tethered to GPS readers swam the extent of each patch and visited anemones inhabited by yellowtail anemonefish. At each anemone, the divers caught fish 3.5 cm and larger, took a tissue sample, measured fork length, and noted tail color as an indicator of life stage \citep{moyer1976geographical}. Starting in 2015, fish 6.0 cm and larger were also tagged with a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag unless already tagged. Divers also looked for eggs around each anemone and measured and photographed any clutches found. In total, we took fin clips from and genotyped 2406 fish and PIT-tagged 1929 fish across all years and patches combined, marking 3053 individual fish. 

\subsection*{Estimating demographic and dispersal parameters from empirical data} 

\paragraph*{Parentage analysis and dispersal kernel}  

Over seven years of sampling, we genotyped 1729 potential parents and 791 juveniles (some fish fall into both categories in different years) at 1340 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and found 71 parent-offspring matches \citep{catalanoInPrepconnectivity}. We used a distance-based generalized Gaussian dispersal kernel fit from the parent-offspring matches \citep{catalanoInPrepconnectivity, bode2018estimating}, where the relative probability of dispersal $p$ is a function of distance $d$ in kilometers and parameters $\theta$ and $K_d$ that control the shape and scale of the kernel (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}a, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}, uncertainty details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}). The dispersal kernel estimates the relative dispersal by distance for fish that have survived and recruited, so it does not separately estimate pre-settlement mortality. To find the one-tailed probability of fish dispersing among our patches, we numerically integrated the dispersal kernel using the distance from the middle of the origin patch ($i$) to the closest ($d_1$) and farthest ($d_2$) edges of the destination patch ($j$), with distances calculated using the \texttt{geosphere} package in R \citep{geosphere2017R}:

\begin{equation} 
p_{i,j} = \frac{e^{K_d}\theta}{2\Gamma({\frac{1}{\theta})}} \int_{d_1}^{d_2}e^{-(e^{K_d}d)^\theta}  dd, \label{EQN_integratingDK}
\end{equation}

where $\Gamma$ indicates the gamma function.

\paragraph*{Growth and survival: mark-recapture analyses}

Fish marked through genotyping and PIT tags allowed us to estimate growth and survival through mark-recapture. In total, we had 3053 marked fish with size and stage data at each capture. 

For growth, we used a von Bertalanffy growth curve:

\begin{equation} \label{EQN_VBL} 
\begin{split}
L_{t+1} & = L_t + (L_\infty - L_t)[1 - e^{(-k)}] \\
 & = e^{(-k)}L_t + L_\infty[1 - e^{(-k)}],
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $L_\infty$ is the asymptotic maximum size across the metapopulation and $k$ is the growth rate. We estimated the parameters from the slope $m$ and y-intercept $b_L$ of the relationship between the length at first capture $L_t$ and the length at a later capture date $L_{t+1}$ for fish recaught a year later (within 345 to 385 days). The von Bertalanffy parameters are $k = -\ln(m)$ and $L_\infty = b_L(1-m)$ \citep{hart2009estimating} (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}, uncertainty details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}).

We used the full set of marked fish to estimate annual survival $\phi$ and probability of recapture $p_r$ using the mark-recapture program MARK implemented in R through the package \texttt{RMark} \citep{RMark_Laake2013}. We fit several models with year, size, and patch effects on the probability of survival on a log-odds scale and selected the model with the lowest $\text{AIC}_c$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}c, details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Growth_and_survival}, uncertainty details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}, and full list of models in Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_MARKmodels}). 

\paragraph*{Fecundity}

From a regression of eggs per clutch on female size while accounting for egg age (determined by the presence of eyed eggs), we found that fecundity increased with size (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{EQN_Fec}, see details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Fecundity}). We only considered reproductive effort for female fish. For sex transition size $L_f$, we used the average size at which recaptured fish were first observed as female (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}d, uncertainty details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}).

\paragraph*{Lifetime egg production (LEP)}

We used an integral projection model (IPM) \citep{ellner2016data} with size as the continuous structuring trait $L$ to estimate lifetime egg production on each patch $i$ ($\text{LEP}_i$). We initialized the IPM with one recruit-sized individual (recruit defined in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Recruit_def}) at the initial annual time step ($t=0$), then projected forward for 100 years. We used the size- and site-dependent survival (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{APP_EQN_Survival}) and growth (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}) functions as the probability density functions in the kernel to project the individual into the next time step, producing a size distribution across time ($v_{L,t}$). We then multiplied by size-dependent fecundity $f_L$ (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{EQN_Fec}). Integrating across time and size, from a minimum size $L_s=0$ cm to a maximum $U_s=15$ cm, gave us the total number of eggs one recruit produced in its lifetime (details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_LEP}, uncertainty details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}):

\begin{equation}
\text{LEP} = \int_{t=0}^{\infty}\int_{L=L_s}^{L=U_s} v_{L,t} f_L dL dt. \label{EQN_LEP}
\end{equation}

We calculated LEP by patch ($\text{LEP}_i$) and averaged across patches ($\text{LEP}_*$) for a fish of recruit size. We also calculated LEP for a fish of parent size (6.0 cm) averaged across patches (LEPp), which is used below to estimate egg-recruit survival.

\paragraph*{Accounting for density dependence}  

We would ideally assess persistence when the population is at low abundance and not limited by density dependence; at high density the population growth rate will slow to zero. Density dependence has not been typically addressed in previous metapopulation persistence studies \citep{johnson2018integrating, carson2011evaluating, hameed2016inverse}, though \cite{salles_coral_2015} considers carrying capacity and available space. Density dependence is particularly clear in anemonefish. Juveniles will prevent others from settling such that each anemone can house only one recently settled anemonefish \citep{buston2003forcible}. This density-dependent mortality reduces the apparent survival of new recruits from our field measurements. We accounted for this effect by scaling up our estimate of recruits (the numerator of eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}, described next) by the proportional increase ($\text{D}$) in unoccupied anemones if all of the anemones occupied by yellowtail anemonefish were unoccupied, where $p_A$ is the proportion of anemones occupied by yellowtail anemonefish and $p_U$ is the proportion of unoccupied anemones: $\text{D} = \frac{(p_U + p_A)}{p_U}$. We present results with this density dependence modification in the main text and without the modification in the appendix (with subscript D in Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_noDD}, Appendix Figs.\ \ref{APP_FIG_LRP_LocalReplacement_noDD}, \ref{APP_FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat_noDD}). 

\paragraph*{Survival from egg to recruit ($S_e$)}

We estimated survival from egg to recruit ($S_e$) using parentage matches to find the number of surviving recruits produced by genotyped parents \citep[similar to][]{johnson2018integrating}. However, the number of offspring we assigned back to parents ($R_m$) is an underestimate of the offspring produced by genotyped parents because it is impossible to sample exhaustively. To account for unsampled offspring, we divided $R_m$ by four factors (described below and with details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_ScalingUpRecruits} and Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_RecruitScalingSchematic}), in addition to multiplying by $\text{D}$ as described above, then divided by the number of eggs produced by genotyped parents:

\begin{equation}
S_e = \frac{\frac{D R_m}{P_h P_c P_d P_s}}{N_g \text{LEPp}}, \label{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}
\end{equation}

where $N_g$ was the number of genotyped parents and $\text{LEPp}$ was the expected lifetime egg production for a fish that has already survived to parent size p (=6.0cm). $P_h$ was the cumulative proportion of habitat in our patches that we sampled over time, $P_c$ was the probability of capturing a fish if we sampled its anemone, $P_d$ was the proportion of the total dispersal kernel from each of our patches covered by our sampling region, and $P_s$ was the proportion of suitable habitat in our sampling region (details in for each in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_ScalingUpRecruits}, uncertainty of $P_c$ in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}).

To estimate the survival and retention of recruits back to our patches (needed for local replacement, LR, eqn. \ref{EQN_LR}), we scaled only by $P_h$ and $P_c$: 

\begin{equation}
R_e = \frac{\frac{D R_m}{P_h P_c}}{N_g \text{LEPp}}. \label{EQN_Re}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Estimated abundance over time} 

We examined trends in abundance of breeding females at each patch over time ($F_{i,t}$) to compare to our replacement-based persistence estimates. As with offspring, we scaled up the number of females caught ($F_{c_{i,t}}$) at each patch $i$ in each sampling year $t$ by the proportion of habitat sampled in that patch and year ($P_{h_{i,t}}$) and by the probability of capturing a fish $P_c$:
\begin{equation}
F_{i,t} = \frac{F_{c_{i,t}}}{P_{h_{i,t}}P_c}
\end{equation}

We fit a mixed effects model with Poisson errors in which $F_{i,t}$ was the response variable, year was the fixed effect, and there were random effects by patch for both intercept and slope using the package \texttt{lme4} in R \citep{lme42015package}.

\subsection*{Exploring alternative geographies and larval navigation}

To understand whether results would likely be similar in other geographies, we tested the sensitivity of metapopulation persistence to alternative patch widths and to the proportion of the region that is habitat. We varied the proportion of habitat and the overall width of the region using 19 equally sized and spaced patches. We created connectivity matrices using the new distances between patches and otherwise used the original parameter values and uncertainty sets, using adult survival ($\phi$) from the patch with median survival (the Elementary School patch) for all patches.

We also tested sensitivity to the ability of larvae to navigate to habitat by adding up to a 1 km buffer to the edges of the destination patches when integrating the dispersal kernel and adjusting the scaling parameter $P_s$ (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}) to account for fewer larvae being lost between patches (details in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Larval_nav}).

\section*{Results} 

\subsection*{Demographic rates}

From field data, mark-recapture, and parentage analyses, we estimated growth (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Growth}), fecundity (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}), annual survival (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}c, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SurvBySizeAndSite}, Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Survival}), lifetime egg production (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}a, Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_LEP}), egg-recruit survival (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_RperE}, Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Egg-recruit_survival}), and the dispersal kernel (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}a, Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Dispersal}). Details and estimated values are in the Results (Appendix B) and Tables (Appendix C) sections of the appendix. These demographic rates form the basis for assessing whether and how the metapopulation persists.

\subsection*{Persistence metrics}

Using our demographic and dispersal results, we estimated average lifetime recruit production (LRP) across patches to be 1.74 [0.93, 5.55] (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}b, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP_R}). Best estimates of $\text{LRP}_i$ at individual patches ranged from 0 to 3.7 (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_PatchSpecificLEPandLRP}, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_LRPbySite}). Averaged across patches, 95\% of LRP estimates were $\geq 1$, which means that individuals produced enough offspring to replace themselves. However, LRP does not tell us whether those offspring settled in locations that contributed to persistence.

Considering retention of larvae at individual patches, we did not find any patches with $\text{SP}_{i} \geq 1$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat}a), suggesting that no patch could persist in isolation. The Haina patch came closest to self-persistence ($\text{SP}_i = 0.088$ [0.009, 0.47]) and had only 0.5\% of uncertainty values $ \geq 1$, making self-persistence very unlikely. 

For network persistence, our estimate of $\lambda_{c}$ was 0.20 [0.11, 0.84], with only 1.2\% of the estimates of $\lambda_c \geq 1$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat}c, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_NP}). Network persistence for this metapopulation was therefore highly unlikely but not impossible. Our estimate of local replacement (LR) was 0.20 [0.11, 0.63], also suggesting lack of independent persistence of this group of patches and very similar to our $\lambda_{c}$ estimate. While both LR and $\lambda_{c}$ provide information on the ability of our patches to persist as an isolated group, they differ in their assumption of the structure of the population. LR approximates the network of patches as a single well-mixed unit, while $\lambda_{c}$ incorporates the spatial structure of the patches and multi-generation dynamics. Results without density dependence compensation also suggested lack of persistence (Appendix Results \ref{APP_SEC_RESULTS_noDD}, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_LRP_LocalReplacement_noDD}).

\subsection*{Abundance}

Our estimated abundance of females over time had a positive trend for the average patch (slope = 1.08, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}d), suggesting a slight increase in population size through time. Most individual patches also showed a positive trend in female abundance through time (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}d, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_AbundanceBySite}). Therefore, though the metapopulation did not exhibit network persistence, it also did not show signs of decline over the time scale of our study. 

\subsection*{Alternative production and geographies}

We then examined what conditions would be needed for this metapopulation to reach persistence. With the existing patch configuration and dispersal kernel, the system would need $\text{LRP} \geq 8.4$ (a five-fold increase) to reach network persistence. In turn, this would require a five-fold increase of egg-recruit survival ($S_e$), or $\text{LEP}_*$, or an equivalent combination of increases across both. If we alternatively considered all arriving recruits as offspring (not just those originating within the metapopulation), LRP would be 11.1, which would be sufficient for persistence. Similarly, our estimate of LR using all recruits arriving to the patches gave an estimate $> 1$ (2.21), also suggesting there was recruit-recruit replacement for the metapopulation when immigrants were included. 

Another route to persistence would be with a different dispersal matrix or habitat density. If dispersal was such that the metapopulation retained all offspring produced, the study region would be persistent because $\text{LRP} > 1$. With the observed dispersal, however, retaining all recruits is difficult to achieve. The coastline had a low fraction of habitat (20\%) and would need to be increased to about 85\% before enough offspring are retained that the point estimate of $\lambda_c \geq 1$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}a). In contrast, widening the region while maintaining the same habitat density (20\%) did not achieve persistence (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}b) unless habitat density was also increased (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}c). As the region widens, the habitat density necessary for persistence decreases, down to 68\% habitat at a region 55 km wide. In contrast, allowing for larval navigation had little impact on persistence estimates (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_WIs}d).

\section*{Discussion}

In this first assessment of demographic persistence of a coastal marine metapopulation, we did not find strong evidence for either self-persistence of an individual patch or network persistence of the entire 30 km area as an isolated region. This inability to persist as an isolated region does not mean that the metapopulation was declining, however. Both population trends and replacement of recruits with immigrants showed that population levels were stable or increasing slightly. Taken together, these metrics suggest that the region required input of immigrants to persist. Despite encompassing a distance substantially larger than mean dispersal, the coastline only persisted as part of a larger metapopulation.

Theory for predicting persistence within patchy habitats has suggested that we expect self-persistence when the mean dispersal distance is small relative to patch size and network persistence in groups of patches when dispersal distances are much larger than patch sizes and where the proportion of habitat in the landscape is about 10-40\% \citep[depending on the particular species, population, and maximum reproductive rate,][]{botsford2019population}. Individual patches in the focal metapopulation were too small for self-persistence, but the 30 km region we sampled was about triple the mean dispersal distance of yellowtail anemonefish estimated from previous genetic work \citep[8-9 km,][]{pinsky2010using, catalanoInPrepconnectivity}. Rather than a continuous patch, however, the region was only about 20\% habitat. Increasing the proportion of habitat, however, suggested that even 40\% habitat coverage would not be sufficient to achieve persistence and this metapopulation would require almost continuous habitat to persist. Similar to fish on small patches in the Caribbean \citep{johnson2018integrating}, this anemonefish metapopulation depends on the production and connectivity of outside patches. One possible path to persistence would be through nearby patches with higher egg production or survival. In such a case, even a small increase in area could create a persistent network. Deeper reefs, for example, are often healthier than shallower reefs \citep{cinner2016bright}. In this system, offshore reefs, with higher coral cover and less silt, could have higher anemonefish survival and contribute disproportionately to regional metapopulation persistence. 

Our finding of a lack of isolated persistence differs markedly from persistence findings of other reef fish metapopulations. On reefs surrounding Kimbe Island, \cite{salles_coral_2015} report self-persistence of individual anemonefish subpopulations in lagoons that were of similar size (approximately 100-500 m long) to our individual patches, as well as network persistence of the 800 m wide metapopulation around the island. This persistence finding is at a dramatically smaller scale than for our focal metapopulation in the Philippines. Additionally, \cite{johnson2018integrating} estimated that four reefs of a combined area of only 2.6 $\text{km}^2$ (four 65 ha patches) would be sufficient for network persistence of a damselfish metapopulation across multiple islands in the Bahamas. This area is roughly equivalent to a 26 km coastline section, which is shorter than our sampling region. To persist, these two offshore metapopulations either had much higher retention of recruits or higher recruit production than did our coastline patches. 

Though lack of sufficient connectivity and retention is thought to inhibit network persistence in some systems \citep[e.g., insufficient retention of offspring within reserves for eastern oysters (\textit{Crassostrea virginica}) in North Carolina;][]{puckett2016metapopulation}, low production of surviving recruits seems the likelier explanation in the Philippines. Recruit production was much lower in the Philippines than in the Kimbe Island populations, where \cite{salles2020strong} estimated that an average individual produced 0.54 offspring over two years that recruited back to the natal population, more than twice our estimate of lifetime local replacement (LR = 0.20). Lower production at our patches could be due to lower egg production, slower growth, or lower adult survival, all likely affected by habitat quality \citep[e.g.][]{salles2020strong, hayashi2019low}. Our study system was near a populated coastline and experienced anthropogenic effects, including pollution and silt, that can reduce demographic rates. Adult survival, for example, was lower at the two patches just downstream of a gravel mine (N. and S. Magbangon). Even at our higher-survival patches (38\% annual survival for a 6 cm fish and 53\% for a 10 cm fish at Tomakin Dako, for example), survival was lower than estimates from the populations at Kimbe Island \citep[85\% annual survival,][]{salles_coral_2015}. Estimates of annual survival in other reef fish species are closer to the lower survival we found for yellowtail anemonefish than the higher survival of \textit{A. percula} at Kimbe Island \citep[approximately 30\% annual survival for bluehead wrasse (\textit{Thalassoma bifasciatum}) and bicolour damselfish (\textit{Stegastes partitus}), respectively;][]{warner1988population, figueira2008small}. Metapopulation growth rates in other reef fish \citep[e.g.,][]{figueira2009connectivity} and marine species more broadly \citep{carson2011evaluating} are highly sensitive to adult survival and other demographic parameters.

Temporal variability in demographic or dispersal parameters on a time scale longer than our sampling might also enable persistence of our patches in isolation \citep[similar to the storage effect,][]{warner1985coexistence} rather than as part of a larger metapopulation. Successful recruitment events on the decadal scale, for example, sustain rockfish populations on the west coast of the United States through the intervening weak recruitment years \citep[e.g.][]{tolimieri2005roles}. Our study could have missed a particularly strong recruitment event driven by variable ocean connectivity \citep[simulations suggest that 20 years are necessary to capture the full extent of ocean variability in the Coral Triangle region surrounding our patches;][]{thompson2018variability}. Strong recruitment would need to occur at least once a generation to maintain patch populations without switching to colonization and extinction dynamics, however, which we do not see. Our study likely spans the generation time of a yellowtail anemonefish (roughly 5 years) so variable strong recruitment, while possible, is unlikely to sustain our populations.

Understanding marine population persistence in the context of broader metapopulation theory requires reconciling replacement-based persistence analysis with classic colonization-extinction and source-sink dynamics \citep{sale2006merging}. At the patch level, many marine metapopulations do not exhibit the colonization-extinction dynamics \citep[or do only on a decades to centuries timescale,][]{smedbol2002myths} that underpin our understanding of many terrestrial metapopulations \citep[e.g,][]{hanski1998metapopulation, moilanen1998long}. Marine metapopulations more often instead consist of continuously-occupied patches connected by dispersal \citep{kritzer2006marine}. Because dispersal is so widespread, patches in marine systems are not easily classified as sources or sinks in the classical fashion \citep{figueira2006defining, white2011oceanographic}. For example, despite being unable to persist in isolation, our region is not technically a sink \citep{pulliam1988sources} because LRP $> 1$. For metapopulations, lack of self-persistence can have two causes: reproduction does not balance mortality losses within a patch (a sink) or sufficient recruits are produced but not retained (as we found in the Philippines). Metapopulations likely lie on a continuum between extinction-colonization dynamics and exchange among populated patches \citep{kritzer2006marine} but the latter many be a more practical approach to characterizing dynamics for metapopulations in which exchange is frequent relative to organisms' generations times \citep{hastings_persistence_2006}. 

In this system and others, density dependence presents a sampling challenge. Persistence criteria \citep{hastings_persistence_2006, burgess2014beyond} ask whether a population at low abundance can grow and recover rather than going extinct. In real populations, however, it can be challenging to estimate density-independent demographic rates because density dependence is occurring in the population as it is sampled during dispersal \citep{nowicki2011evidence} and reproduction \citep{rodenhouse2003multiple}. In anemonefish, density dependence is likely most important immediately post-settlement, as it is for many species, including corals, trees, and butterflies \citep{vermeij2008density, harms2000pervasive, nowicki2009relative}. However, density dependence could continue to be important throughout life due to social hierarchies in anemonefish colonies \citep{buston2011determinants}. Our calculations of persistence in this paper did not account for longer term post-settlement density dependence, which would be an interesting area of further research.

Understanding persistence is critical for the management of spatial populations, such as siting marine protected areas \citep{kaplan_model-based_2009}, assessing habitat fragmentation risks \citep{smith2002population, fahrig2001much} and conserving species in the face of climate change \citep{coleman2017anticipating, fuller2015persistence}. Though models and theory provide us with expectations, we are only beginning to tackle these questions empirically. While rules of thumb have been widely used in marine ecology and conservation, they may be far from accurate for many study systems. Fortunately, tools now exist to permit a more precise evaluation of demographic rates that can enable assessment of persistence --- or lack thereof. Spatial scales of metapopulation persistence in marine systems are likely to be large, despite evidence that dispersal distances are shorter than previously expected \citep{jones1999self, almany2007local}. Importantly, persistence of coastal metapopulations may rely on high quality habitat refugia to a greater extent than has been widely recognized.

\section{Supplemental Methods} \label{APP_SUPP_METHODS}

\subsection{Defining recruit and census stage} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_Recruit_def}

When assessing persistence, we must consider mortality and reproduction that occurs across the entire life cycle to determine whether an individual is replacing itself with an individual that reaches the same life stage \citep{burgess2014beyond}. We defined a recruit to be a juvenile individual that has settled on the reef within the previous year, which also encompasses the size of fish we were first able to sample (3.5--6.0 cm for parentage studies) (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Metric_life_cycle_schematics}e, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Schematic}). In theory, it does not matter how we defined recruit as long as we used the same definition in our calculations of both egg-recruit survival (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}) and LEP (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}). In our system, however, while it is straightforward to calculate LEP from any size, we did not have enough tagged recruits to reliably estimate survival from an egg to different recruit sizes. Instead, we chose the mean size of offspring matched in the parentage study as our best estimate of the size of a recruit ($\text{size}_\text{recruit} = 4.4$ cm) and tested sensitivity to different recruit sizes by sampling from a uniform distribution over the sizes the recruit stage covers (3.5--6.0 cm, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}, Appendix Figs.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP}-\ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_NP}).

\subsection{Self persistence (SP)} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_SP}

Our equation for SP (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_SP}) is a modification of that used in \cite{burgess2014beyond}, which uses LEP to represent offspring produced and local retention (the number of surviving recruits that disperse back to the natal patch divided by the number of eggs produced by the natal patch) to capture egg-recruit survival and dispersal combined: $\text{LEP } \text{x } \text{local retention} \geq 1$. We modify this to include egg-recruit survival in the offspring term instead, using LRP in place of LEP and probability of dispersal ($p_{i,i}$) in place of local retention.

\subsection{Growth and survival} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_Growth_and_survival}

To include size in the mark-recapture models for post-recruit survival ($\phi$) and recapture probability ($p_r$), we estimated sizes for fish in years when they were not recaptured. We used the growth model (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}) and the size recorded or estimated in the previous year to estimate the size of fish not recaptured in a particular year. Fish were not well-mixed at our patches, and divers needed to swim near an anemone to have a reasonable chance of capturing the fish on it. Therefore, we also included a distance effect on recapture probability (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{APP_EQN_MARK_Recapture}, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_MARKmodels}). We used diver GPS tracks to estimate the minimum distance between a diver and the anemone where the fish was first caught for each tagged fish in each sample year.

We compared the fit of the models using a modified version of the Akaike information criterion that reduces the potential for overfitting with small sample sizes (AICc) and selected the model with the lowest AICc value (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_MARKmodels}).

\subsection{Fecundity} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_Fecundity}

We used a size-dependent fecundity relationship determined using photos of egg clutches and females from field sampling, where the number of eggs per clutch ($E_c$) is exponentially related to the length in cm of the female ($L$) with size effect $\beta_l = 2.388$, intercept $b = 1.174$, and egg age effect $\beta_e = -0.608$ dependent on if the eggs were old enough to have visible eyes. For fish larger or equal to the transition to female size $L_f$, we multiplied the number of eyed eggs per clutch by the number of clutches per year $c_e = 11.9$ \citep[estimate from][]{holtswarth2017fecundity} to get total annual fecundity $f$ for a female of length $L$:

\begin{equation}
f_L = 
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{if } L < L_f \\
c_e * e^{\beta_l\ln(L) + \beta_e[\text{eyed}] + b}, & L \geq L_f. \label{EQN_Fec}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

We did not consider uncertainty in fecundity but did consider uncertainty in the transition size to breeding female (Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}).

\subsection{Lifetime egg production (LEP)} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_LEP}

To compute LEP, we discretized time and size (in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}), using 100 time steps and 100 equal size bins, and summed across the matrix. When entering the starting individual into the matrix, we used 0.1 as the standard deviation of size to spread out the starting individual across size bins. The size disribution at each time ($v_{L,t}$) represents the probability that the individual has survived and grown into each of the possible size categories. To account for differences in growth rates across fish, we used the size determined by the growth curve (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}) as the mean along with an estimate of spread ($\text{size}_{sd}$) when projecting the size distribution of the fish in the next year. To estimate $\text{size}_{sd}$, we selected fish within 0.1 cm of the mean size at the first capture point for fish recaptured a year later (7.4--7.6 cm). We used the standard deviation of the sizes of those fish when they were recaptured one year later as $\text{size}_{sd}$ (=1.45) (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}). 

LEP was estimated by patch ($\text{LEP}_i$) because each patch has a different estimate of adult survival. We also present the average LEP across patches, noted as $\text{LEP}_*$ (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}b) and used to estimate average LRP and LR for the metapopulation (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}c, d). 

To estimate egg-recruit survival ($S_e$), we used the expected lifetime egg production for a fish that has already survived to reach parent size (6.0 cm) so $L_s$ in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP} = 6.0, rather than 3.5. We used the average LEP for parent-sized fish across patches, noted as LEPp.

\subsection{Accounting for density dependence} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_DD}

In 2015 and 2017, we did a more thorough survey of anemones at sampled patches and noted anemones occupied by yellowtail anemonefish, occupied by other species of anemonefish, and unoccupied by anemonefish. We found the proportion of anemones occupied by yellowtail anemonefish ($p_A$) and the proportion of anemones unoccupied by any anemonefish ($p_U$) for all patches combined and averaged across the two sample years. We used these average proportions to estimate the proportional increase (D) in unoccupied anemones if all anemones occupied by yellowtail anemonefish were unoccupied as described in the main text. We did not consider uncertainty in the effect of density dependence.

\subsection{Alternative geographies and larval navigation} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_Larval_nav}

\paragraph*{Larval navigation} 

In our sensitivity test for larval navigation and swimming abilities, we added a buffer ranging from 0--1 km to the edges of the destination patches when determining probability of dispersal between patches. To avoid overlapping shadows of effective area of neighboring patches, we added no more than half the distance between two adjacent patches to each patch. The buffers also changed the proportion of the sampling region that was habitat ($P_h$, see Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_ScalingUpRecruits}), as we considered the buffer areas to be habitat as well, and affected the scaling of recruits (Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_ScalingUpRecruits}) in egg-recruit survival (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}).

\subsection{Scaling up recruits} \label{APP_SEC_METHODS_ScalingUpRecruits}

To estimate the total number of offspring produced by genotyped parents that survived to recruitment, we scaled up the number of matched offspring caught during sampling ($R_m$) to account for recruits our sampling could have missed (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_RecruitScalingSchematic}). We scaled up by 1) the cumulative proportion of habitat we sampled at our patches over time ($P_h$) to account for recruits at anemones we did not sample, 2) the probability of capturing a fish if we sampled its anemone ($P_c$) to account for fish that escaped during sampling, 3) the proportion of the dispersal kernel from our patches covered within our sampling region ($P_d$) to account for fish that dispersed outside of our sampling area (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_PropDispKernelAreaSampled}), and 4) the proportion of our sampling region that was habitat ($P_s$) to avoid counting mortality of fish dispersing to non-habitat within our region twice. The latter term is important because mortality from dispersing to non-habitat is both in the estimate of total recruits (numerator of eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}) and in the integrated dispersal kernel (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_integratingDK}). 

\paragraph*{Proportion of habitat sampled ($P_h$)} 

We used tagged anemones to estimate the proportion of habitat we sampled within our patches (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_PercHabSampled}). We tagged each anemone that was home to yellowtail anemonefish with a metal tag, which is relatively permanent and easy to re-sight (the anemone tag is visible above the anemone in Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Map_and_photo}c). We therefore considered the total number of metal-tagged anemones at a patch to be the habitat present. We used proportion of anemones rather than proportion of total patch area because anemones, and therefore habitat quality, were unevenly distributed across each patch; areas we did not visit typically had a lower anemone density than the areas we did sample. 

To scale the number of sampled offspring from genotyped parents ($R_m$) to account for areas of our patches we did not sample, we used the overall proportion habitat sampled across all patches and sampling years ($P_h$). We summed the number of metal-tagged anemones we visited across all patches and years, then divided by the number of anemones we could have sampled (the sum of total metal-tagged anemones across all patches multiplied by the number of sampling years) (anemone numbers sampled by patch and year in Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_PercHabSampled}). We did not consider uncertainty in the proportion of habitat sampled.

\paragraph*{Probability of capturing a fish, from recapture dives ($P_c$)} 

We used the probability of capturing a fish to scale up the number of sampled offspring from genotyped parents ($R_m$) to account for recruits we missed by failing to capture them. To estimate the probability of capturing a fish given that we sampled its anemone ($P_c$), we used mark-recapture data from recapture dives done within a sampling season. During some of the sampling years, we intentionally re-sampled some locations within a few weeks of the original sampling dives. We assumed that the probability of recapturing a fish on a recapture dive was the same as capturing a fish on a sampling dive, essentially that there was no mortality in the weeks between dives and that the fish did not alter their behavior towards divers. For each recapture dive, we used GPS tracks of the divers to identify the anemones covered in the recapture dive and the set of PIT-tagged fish encountered on those anemones during the original sampling dives. We estimated the probability of capture $P_c$ as the number of tagged fish re-caught from the capture dive $m_2$ divided by the total number of fish caught on the recapture dive $n_2$: $P_c = \frac{m_2}{n_2}$. 

We used the mean $P_c$ across all 14 recapture dives, covering 10 patches over three sampling seasons (2016, 2017, 2018), as our best estimate. Uncertainty details are in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}.

\paragraph*{Proportion of dispersal kernel area sampled ($P_d$)} 

To account for recruits that dispersed outside our sampling region, we found the proportion of the dispersal kernels from all parents that fell within our sampling region (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_PropDispKernelAreaSampled}). For each patch \textit{i}, we found the area under the kernel ($A_i$) from the center of the patch to the north edge of the sampling area ($d_{N,i}$) (northern-most tagged anemone at Palanas, the northern-most patch) and from the center of the patch to the south edge of the sampling area ($d_{S,i}$) (southern-most tagged anemone at Sitio Baybayon, the southern-most patch), then multiplied by the number of genotyped parents at that patch ($N_{g_i}$):

\begin{equation} 
A_i = N_{g_i} \frac{e^{K_d}\theta}{2\Gamma({\frac{1}{\theta})}} \left( \int_{0}^{d_N}e^{-(e^{K_d}d)^\theta}  dd + \int_{0}^{d_S}e^{-(e^{K_d}d)^\theta}  dd \right). 
\end{equation}

We added the areas together, then divided by the total number of genotyped parents ($N_g$) to get the proportion of the total dispersal kernel area covered by our sampling region ($P_d$):

\begin{equation}
P_d = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{19} A_i}{N_g}. \label{EQN_DK_area_within_sampling_region}
\end{equation}

We did not consider uncertainty in $P_d$.

\paragraph*{Proportion habitat in sampling area ($P_s$)} 

To avoid implicitly counting mortality due to larvae settling on non-habitat twice --- once in scaling up our matched recruits (who settled on habitat) and once in integrating the dispersal kernel --- we scaled the estimate of total recruits produced by parents on our patches by the proportion of our sampling region that was habitat ($P_s$). We found $P_s$ by summing the lengths of all the patches, which run approximately north-south, and dividing by the total north-south distance of our sampling region, giving $P_s = 0.20$. We assumed that larvae were unable to navigate to habitat if they dispersed to an unsuitable area but relaxed that assumption in our sensitivity tests (Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_METHODS_Larval_nav}) because anemonefish larvae do likely have some ability both to sense good settlement areas by detecting host anemones \citep{elliott1995host, arvedlund1999host} or conspecifics \citep[e.g.,][for coral reef fish more broadly]{lecchini2005experimental}, and to swim in a particular direction \citep[e.g.,][]{bellwood2001relative, fisher2005swimming}. 

\subsection{Characterizing uncertainty} \label{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}

\paragraph*{Dispersal kernel} 

To account for uncertainty in the dispersal kernel, we used sets of the shape parameter $\theta$ and the scale parameter $K_d$ that represented the span of the 95\% confidence interval when $K_d$ and $\theta$ were estimated jointly \citep[Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}a,][]{catalanoInPrepconnectivity}. We randomly sampled pairs of $\theta$ and $K_d$ parameters from within the 95\% confidence intervals, weighted by the log-likelihood. 

\paragraph*{Growth} 

We used the first and second capture lengths for fish that were recaught after a year (within 345 to 385 days) to estimate $L_\infty$ and $k$ (using eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}). For fish recaptured more than once, we randomly selected only one recapture period from each to use to estimate the von Bertalanffy parameters and repeated the random selection and estimate 1000 times. We found the mean estimates ($L_\infty$ = 10.70 cm, $k$ = 0.864) and mean standard error of those fits, then sampled uniformly from within the average 95\% range to generate a set of von Bertalanffy growth curves to use in our LEP calculations (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}b, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}).

\paragraph*{Survival ($\phi$)} 

We incorporated uncertainty in adult survival by sampling uniformly from within the 95\% confidence limits for the patch-based survival estimates and size effect on survival as estimated by the lowest AICc model from MARK (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_SiteSurvivals}, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SurvBySizeAndSite}). For the simulations for the alternative geographies and larval navigation, we used the survival estimate and 95\% range for the patch with median survival (the Elementary School patch) (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}). 

\paragraph*{Size of transition to female ($L_f$)} 

To incorporate uncertainty in the size at which male fish transition to female ($L_f$), we sampled with replacement directly from the sizes at which recaptured fish were first captured as female (5.2--12.7 cm) (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}d). Reproductive output is only counted once fish reach the female stage, so $L_f$ affects fecundity (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{EQN_Fec}) and therefore the fecundity kernel in calculating lifetime egg production ($f_L$ in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}).

\paragraph*{Recruit size ($\text{size}_\text{recruit}$)} 

We incorporated uncertainty in the size of a recruit ($\text{size}_\text{recruit}$) by sampling from a uniform distribution across the ranges of possible sizes of recruits for the parentage analysis (3.5--6.0 cm) (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}a). Recruit size enters into LEP as the starting size of the individual fish in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}.

\paragraph*{Probability of capturing a fish ($P_c$)} 

To consider uncertainty in the probability of capturing a fish given that we sampled its anemone ($P_c$), we represented the probability of capture as a beta distribution, using the mean $\mu_{P_c}$ and variance $V_{P_c}$ of the set of 14 values calculated from individual recapture dives to find the appropriate $\alpha_{P_c}$ and $\beta_{P_c}$ parameters, where 

\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha_{P_c} &=& (\frac{1-\mu_{P_c}}{V_{P_c}} - \frac{1}{\mu_{P_c}}) \mu_{P_c}^2 \\
\beta_{P_c} &=& \alpha_{\mu_{P_c}} \times \frac{1}{\mu_{P_c} - 1}. \label{APP_EQN_ProbCapBetaDistParams}  
\end{eqnarray}

The mean of the individual capture probability values was $\mu_{P_c} = 0.56$, with variance $V_{P_c} = 0.069$, giving beta distribution parameters $\alpha_{P_c} = 1.44$ and $\beta_{P_c} = 1.13$. We sampled 1000 values from the beta distribution, then truncated the sample to include only values larger or equal to the lowest value of $P_c$ estimated from an individual dive (0.20), to avoid unrealistically low values randomly sampled from the distribution. We then sampled with replacement from the truncated set to get a vector of 1000 values (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}c). $P_c$ is one of the scaling factors in the estimate of egg-recruit survival (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_EggRecruitSurv}), accounting for recruits we missed by failing to capture them.

\paragraph*{Lifetime Egg Production (LEP)} 

Uncertainty in lifetime egg production enters through adult survival, growth, and the size of a recruit (Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}), all of which affect the size distribution across time $v_{L,t}$ in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}. Additionally, uncertainty in the size of transition to female ($L_f$, Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}) affects the fecundity kernel $f_L$ in eqn.\ \ref{EQN_LEP}. We show the contribution of uncertainty of each input in Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP}.

\paragraph*{Egg-recruit survival ($S_e$)} 

In estimating egg-recruit survival ($S_e$), we considered uncertainty in the number of offspring assigned to parents ($R_m$) and in the probability of capturing a fish ($P_c$). For offspring assigned to parents, we generated a set of values for the number of assigned offspring using a random binomial, with the number of genotyped offspring (791) as the number of trials and the assignment rate from the parentage analysis (0.090) as the probability of success on each trial \citep{catalanoInPrepconnectivity} (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}d). Uncertainty in probability of capture $P_c$ is described in Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}. We show the contribution of uncertainty of each input in Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_RperE}.

\section{Supplemental Results} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS} 

\subsection{Parentage} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Parentage}

From the genetic work and parentage analysis done in \cite{catalanoInPrepconnectivity}, we genotyped 1729 potential parents, genotyped 791 potential offspring (recruits), and matched 71 offspring to parents, with an assignment rate of 9\%. In estimates with uncertainty, the middle 95\% of the distribution of matched offspring was 55 to 87 (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}d, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}).

The combined number of potential parents and potential offspring is higher than the number of genotyped fish because some fish are included as both a potential offspring and a potential parent (in different years).

\subsection{Dispersal kernel} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Dispersal}

We used the dispersal kernel estimated for all years together in \cite{catalanoInPrepconnectivity} (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_integratingDK}), with $K_d = -2.51$ and $\theta = 1.49$. Using the 95\% confidence surface when $K_d$ and $\theta$ were estimated jointly to incoporate uncertainty (Appendix Methods \ref{APP_SEC_Uncertainty}), $K_d$ ranged from $-2.86$ to $-1.82$ and $\theta$ from 0.87 to 2.46 (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}a, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}).

\subsection{Growth} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Growth}

From the mark-recapture analysis of tagged and genotyped fish, we estimated mean values of $L_\infty = 10.70$ cm with uncertainty bounds of 9.0--12.8 cm using the 95\% confidence bounds with average standard error across fits and $k = 0.864$ with uncertainty bounds 0.73--1.01 for the von Bertalanffy growth curve parameters (eqn.\ \ref{EQN_VBL}, Fig.\ \ref{FIG_ParameterInputs}b, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}). 

\subsection{Survival} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Survival}

The best model for post-recruitment annual survival $\phi$ on a log-odds scale had a positive size effect ($b_a = 0.15 \pm 0.029$ SE) with intercepts $b_{\phi_i}$ varying by patch (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{APP_EQN_Survival}, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SurvBySizeAndSite}, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_SiteSurvivals}):

\begin{equation}
\ln(\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}) = b_{\phi_i} + b_a\text{size}. \label{APP_EQN_Survival}
\end{equation}

The accompanying best model for recapture probability $p_r$ on a log-odds scale had a negative effect of size ($b_1 = -0.16 \pm 0.09$ SE) and a negative effect of diver distance $d$ from the capture anemone ($b_2 = -0.15 \pm 0.02$ SE), with intercept $b_{p_r} = 2.14 \pm 0.87$ SE (Appendix eqn.\ \ref{APP_EQN_MARK_Recapture}, Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_RecapSizeDistEffect}):

\begin{equation}
\ln(\frac{p_r}{1-p_r}) = b_{p_r} + b_1\text{size} + b_2d. \label{APP_EQN_MARK_Recapture}
\end{equation}

This suggests divers were less likely to recapture larger fish, who are stronger swimmers and more likely to flee when divers approach, and those at anemones far from areas sampled.

\subsection{Scaling factors} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_ScalingFactors}

The proportion of habitat at patches sampled over time ($P_h$) was 0.41, the proportion of the region that was habitat ($P_s$) was 0.20, the proportion of the dispersal kernel that was within the sampling region ($P_d$) was 0.57, and the probability of capturing a fish given that its anemone was sampled ($P_c$) was 0.56, with middle 95\% 0.22--0.97 (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_UncertaintyInputs}c, Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_Params}).

\subsection{Lifetime egg production (LEP)} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_LEP}  

We calculated an average value of LEP across patches ($\text{LEP}_*$) of 827 [266, 3213] eggs (Fig.\ \ref{FIG_Abun_LEP_LRP_LocalReplacement}a), with best estimate values at individual patches that ranged from 0 to 1760 eggs (Appendix Table \ref{APP_TAB_PatchSpecificLEPandLRP}). Uncertainty in adult survival had the largest effect on LEP (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_LEP}), which corresponds to longer-surviving individuals having more opportunities to reproduce at larger sizes. 

\subsection{Egg-recruit survival ($S_e$)} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_Egg-recruit_survival}  

We estimated egg-recruit survival $S_{e}$ to be 0.002 [5 x $10^{-4}$, 0.01] when we accounted for density dependence in our data. Uncertainty in the size of transition to breeding female $L_f$ had the largest effect on egg-recruit survival (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_Uncertainty_RperE}); the larger the transition size to female, the fewer tagged eggs we estimated were produced by our genotyped parents and the higher the estimate of egg-recruit survival. This differs from our finding above that adult survival had the largest effect on LEP because the starting size of the individual considered is lower when we estimate LEP for a recruit (4.4 cm, 3.5--6.0 cm range) than for a parent (6.0 cm). Fish considered parents in our parentage analysis have already survived one or more years since recruiting so the transition to breeding female plays a larger role in the number of eggs they are likely to produce than for fish who have just recruited. 

\subsection{Persistence metrics without compensation for density dependence} \label{APP_SEC_RESULTS_noDD}

Estimating persistence metrics without compensating for density dependence in our data (presented with a subscript D) gave us an understanding of whether individuals at our patches were able to replace themselves and whether our patches would persist in isolation at the current abundance levels, rather than at low abundance. Without compensation for early life density dependence, all of our metrics showed that the set of patches we sampled was less likely to persist as an isolated network than the metrics for low abundance. We estimated egg-recruit survival ($S_{e_{D}}$) to be 0.001 [3 x $10^{-4}$, 0.005] and average lifetime recruit production across patches ($\text{LRP}_{D}$) to be 0.96 [0.51, 3.07], with 52\% of $\text{LRP}_{D}$ estimates $\geq 1$ (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_LRP_LocalReplacement_noDD}a). Our estimate of local replacement ($\text{LR}_{D}$), which estimates replacement for recruits from our patches returning to our patches implictly including dispersal, was 0.11 [0.06, 0.35] (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_LRP_LocalReplacement_noDD}b). 

When we calculated LR using all arriving recruits to our patches, however, rather than just those originating there, the best estimate was $> 1$ (1.22), suggesting that there was recruit-recruit replacement at our patches when we included immigrant recruits, even at current population levels when density dependence was present.

We did not find any patches with a best estimate of $\text{SP}_{D} \geq 1$ or with uncertainty bounds that reached or exceeded 1 (Appendix Figs.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat_noDD}a). Our best estimate of the dominant eigenvalue of the realized connectivity matrix $\lambda_{c_{D}}$ was 0.11 [0.06, 0.47] with 0\% of estimates where $\lambda_{c_{D}} \geq 1$ (Appendix Fig.\ \ref{APP_FIG_SP_NP_realizedCmat_noDD}c).
