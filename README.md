# Clownfish_persistence

Draft list of cleaned-up scripts in progress:

* Pull_data_from_database: pulls data from database, saves as RData files for other users
* Constants_database_common_functions: processes raw data from database into useable dataframes, sets constants, reads in data from other analyses
* Total_anems_proportion_hab_sampled: finds the total number anems at a site (we used tagged anems as best estimate of total), calculates proportion habitat sampled at each site in each sampling year
